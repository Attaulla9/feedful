  "description": "23-yr-old Kerala trekker Babu was trapped in a 'fault-line' or crevice on a hill at Palakkad district of Kerala. However, the trekker was finally rescued by Army. The specialised mountaineering unit of the Army rescued him from the deep forests of the Palakkad Gap, which is teeming with wildlife. A member of the Army rescue team reached the spot where Babu had been trapped for more than 40 hours and gave him food and water. Babu was raised 1000 meters from the bottom of the crevice to the mountain top,  with the help of a rope.  The crevice is located on a sheer hill face. Rescuers needed five hours to reach the spot.  Babu had trekked up the mountain with two friends on Monday. While descending, he had slipped and fallen into a deep gorge. He injured his leg in the process. His friends, who failed to rescue him themselves, reached the base of the hill and informed authorities. ",
