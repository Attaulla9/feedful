  "description": "Strong defense and above-average shooting led Michigan Tech men's basketball to a 90-75 victory over Wisconsin Parkside Saturday night at De Simone Arena. Adam Hobson led the offense with 20 points, including multiple three-pointers in the second half to help the Huskies create separation on the scoreboard. Veterans Owen White and Trent Bell posted 19 points apiece and Bell added a double-double with a team-high 11 rebounds.Â ",
