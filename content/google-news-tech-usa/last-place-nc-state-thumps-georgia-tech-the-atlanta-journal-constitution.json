  "description": "There was little sign of a team getting better or close to turning the corner Tuesday night. The belief and hopes of Georgia Tech coach Josh Pastner that his team could still finish the season strongly were, at the least, delayed by one more game as Tech absorbed one of the more humbling losses of Pastnerâ€™s six-year tenure, a 76-61 loss to N.C. State at McCamish Pavilion.",
