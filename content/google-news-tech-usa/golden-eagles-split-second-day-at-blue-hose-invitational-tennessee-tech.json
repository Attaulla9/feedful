  "description": "CLINTON, S.C. -- One thing the Tennessee Tech softball team showed on Saturday is resiliency. After falling behind early in both games on Saturday in the Blue Hose Invitational, the Golden Eagles found ways to knot the games up.\n\nHowever, both games ended in opposite directions as the Golden Eagles blasted South Carolina State 13-2 in five innings, then Northern Kentucky hit a one-out, walk-off home run to hand Tech its first defeat of the season 6-5.\n\nThe Golden Eagles (3-1) close out the Blue Hose Invitational on Sunday as they take on South Carolina State with first pitch slated for 1:30 p.m.",
