  "description": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. â€“ The bats were swinging well on Friday as the Tennessee Tech softball team went 2-0 on the first day of the Chattanooga Challenge. The Golden Eagles drove in 21 total runs in two games, run-ruling Purdue Fort Wayne 16-2 in five innings, then shutting out Northwestern State 5-0 in the second game.\n\nHaeli Bryson continued her hot streak, driving in seven RBI on the day as she was 3-for-7 at the plate. In the first seven games of the season, Bryson has 15 total RBI, eight shy of the total team-leading 23 collected by Nicolle Nysted last season. The team as a whole has 51, over a third of the 144 driven in at the conclusion of the season.",
