  "description": "A mix of sports and soap opera will be on display when No. 11 Texas Tech and No. 20 Texas meet for the second time this season at 11:30 a.m. on Saturday at the Frank Erwin Center in Austin. Tech head coach Mark Adams led the Red Raiders to a 77-64 win over the Longhorns in the first matchup on February 1 in Lubbock following a coaching change that saw him take over the program from Chris Beard who left for Texas last April.",
