  "description": "Can Duke deliver to Mike Krzyzewski a final ACC tournament championship to end his 42-year run in the conference? Or will North Carolina, Virginia Tech or someone else in the league come along and cut down the nets?This year’s ACC tournament from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. will be dominated by the storyline of Coach K looking for his 16th ACC tournament title. The Blue Devils won the ACC regular-season title, but ended the regular season with a loss to rival North Carolina that was the talk of the sport. Duke is now within one win — against No. 4 seed Miami in Friday's semifinals — from a championship game appearance.On the other side of the bracket is rival UNC, which will play bubble hopeful Virginia Tech in Friday's late game. The two winners play Saturday night for the ACC tournament title.Where every ACC team stands for making the NCAA Tournament: Eamonn Brennan's Bubble WatchWhere the ACC is seeded in this year's NCAA Tournament: Brian Bennett's Bracket WatchTuesday, March 8First RoundGame 1: Boston College 66, Pittsburgh 46Game 2: Clemson 70, NC State 64Game 3: Louisville 84, Georgia Tech 74Wednesday, March 9Second RoundGame 4: No. 9 Syracuse 96, Florida State 57Game 5: No. 13 Boston College 82, Wake Forest 77Game 6: No. 7 Virginia Tech 76, Clemson 75 (OT)Game 7: No. 6 Virginia 51, Louisville 50Thursday, March 10QuarterfinalsGame 8: No. 1 Duke 88, Syracuse 79Game 9: No. 4 Miami 71, Boston College 69Game 10: No. 7 Virginia Tech 87, No. 2 Notre Dame 80Game 11: No. 3 North Carolina 63, No. 6 Virginia 43Friday, March 11SemifinalsGame 12: No. 1 Duke 80, No. 4 Miami 76Game 13: No. 7 Virginia Tech 72, No. 3 North Carolina 59Saturday, March 12ChampionshipGame 14: No. 7 Virginia Tech 82, No. 1 Duke 67(Photo: Getty Images)",
