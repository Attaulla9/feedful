  "description": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. – The Tennessee Tech softball team lost a heartbreaker on Sunday afternoon to close out the Chattanooga Challenge as the Golden Eagles took the lead in the top of the seventh inning, only to see Radford dash their hopes for the win with a walkoff home run to fall to the Highlanders 5-4.\n\nTech (7-3) will return home to take on Northern Iowa for a midweek contest to open the season’s action at Tech Softball Field on Wednesday, weather permitting. First pitch is slated for 3 p.m. and admission is free.",
