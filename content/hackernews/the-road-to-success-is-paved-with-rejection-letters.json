  "description": "Let's get this out of the way up front. I'm a successful academic. I have one of the best jobs in academia (Max Planck director). I've been able to do work that I care about, with great colleagues and students, and it's been recognized by my community.Â  I'm white, male, and straight. I was raised by educated, caring, parents who were not rich, but not poor. I'm definitely privileged. Life gave me a good shot at success right out of the gate.\n\n\n",
