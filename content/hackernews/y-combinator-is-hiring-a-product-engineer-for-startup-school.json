  "description": "Startup School is Y Combinatorâ€™s free, online platform for early-stage founders.&nbsp;\n\nIn the last year, we've moved the whole startup course [online](https://www.startupschool.org), started a new track for [aspiring founders,](https://www.startupschool.org/aspiring-founders) and launched a [co-founder matching platform](https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching).&nbsp;\n\nWe have a lot more exciting stuff to deliver, so we're looking to hire a full-stack product engineer to join our team. This is a great role for someone who loves helping startups and wants to own and build projects from 0 to 1.\n\nWe work primarily in Ruby on Rails and React (learning on the job is fine), and we spend a lot of our time coding. That said, we encourage everyone to participate in all of YC -- join our batch talks and events, help out with Demo Day, and speak up on the projects you'd want to work on.\n\nThe YC software team you'd be joining has 10 people with lots of collective years of start-up and big company experience, so you'll get the best of both worlds: moving fast and shipping _and_ strong teammates/mentors to help you learn. Startup School is currently a team of 3. We're open to folks 2+ years out of school or even those with 10+ years of experience. Lastly, the work-life balance is great, and you get to work with people across the company.\n\nIf this sounds like an interesting opportunity, we welcome you to apply!\n\n## Location and benefits\n\n- Our team is 100% remote for the time being, however, we have offices in Mountain View.\n\n- Full benefits package including medical, vision, and dental benefits, STD/LTD, life insurance, commuter benefits, flexible spending account, 401(k) + 4% matching, generous parental leave, and flexible sick and vacation policy.\n\n[Notice for Colorado applicants as required by sb19-085 (8-5-20)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRVow-LswuQtTY-vy1TAKP7JEQ38sQ0U_v0bsyTMnETdQ7RPFmDN33ZV6MyxGMymoDuQw5kQcq6xjCl/pub)\n\n_Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with criminal history in a manner consistent with the requirements of this law._\n\n",
