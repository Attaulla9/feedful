  "description": "Project Management anti-patterns are well-documented in the\nsoftware-engineering literature, and studying them allows understanding their\nimpacts on teams and projects. The video game development industry is known for\nits mismanagement practices, and therefore applying this knowledge would help\nimproving game developers' productivity and well-being. In this paper, we map\nproject management anti-patterns to anti-patterns reported by game developers\nin the gray literature. We read 440 postmortems problems, identified\nanti-pattern candidates, and related them with definitions from the\nsoftware-engineering literature. We discovered that most anti-pattern\ncandidates could be mapped to anti-patterns in the software-engineering\nliterature, except for Feature Creep, Feature Cuts, Working on Multiple\nProjects, and Absent or Inadequate Tools. We discussed the impact of the\nunmapped candidates on the development process while also drawing a parallel\nbetween video games and traditional software development. Future works include\nvalidating the definitions of the candidates via survey with practitioners and\nalso considering development anti-patterns.",
