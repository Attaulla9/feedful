  "description": "Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHs) are a fascinating byproduct of\ngalaxy mergers in the hierarchical universe. In the last stage of their orbital\nevolution, gravitational wave radiation drives the binary inspiral and produces\nthe loudest siren awaiting to be detected by gravitational wave observatories.\nPeriodically varying emission from active galactic nuclei has been proposed as\na powerful approach to probe such systems, although none of the identified\ncandidates are close to their final coalescence such that the observed periods\nstay constant in time. In this work, we report on the first system with rapid\ndecaying periods revealed by its optical and X-ray light curves, which has\ndecreased from about one year to one month in three years. Together with its\noptical hydrogen line spectroscopy, we propose that the system is an uneven\nmass-ratio, highly eccentric SMBH binary which will merge within three years,\nas predicted by the trajectory evolution model. If the interpretation is true,\ncoordinated, multi-band electromagnetic campaign should be planned for this\nfirst binary SMBH merger event observed in human history, together with\npossible neutrino measurements. Gravitational wave memory from this event may\nalso be detectable by Pulsar Timing Array with additional five-to-ten year\nobservation.",
