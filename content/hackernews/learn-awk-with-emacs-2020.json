  "description": "Intro   This post describes my workflow for learning the AWK programming language using Emacs, Org mode and Org-drill. The workflow may work for other programming languages. The post won't cover details on how to use Emacs, Org mode or Org-drill. It's intention is to provide a general overview of a workflow.\n A git repo is available with flash cards, note book and some text files here.",
