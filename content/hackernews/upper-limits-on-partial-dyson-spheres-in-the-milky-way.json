  "description": "Dyson spheres are hypothetical megastructures built by advanced\nextraterrestrial civilizations to harvest radiation energy from stars. Here, we\ncombine optical data from Gaia DR2 with mid-infrared data from AllWISE to set\nthe strongest upper limits to date on the prevalence of partial Dyson spheres\nwithin the Milky Way, based on their expected waste-heat signatures.\nConservative upper limits are presented on the fraction of stars at G $\\leq$ 21\nthat may potentially host non-reflective Dyson spheres that absorb 1 - 90$\\%$\nof the bolometric luminosity of their host stars and emit thermal waste-heat in\nthe 100 - 1000 K range. Based on a sample of $\\approx$ $2.7\\mathrm{e}\\,5$ stars\nwithin 100 pc, we find that a fraction less than $\\approx$ $2\\mathrm{e}\\,-5$\ncould potentially host $\\sim$300 K Dyson spheres at 90$\\%$ completion. These\nlimits become progressively weaker for less complete Dyson spheres due to\nincreased confusion with naturally occurring sources of strong mid-infrared\nradiation, and also at larger distances, due to the detection limits of WISE.\nFor the $\\sim2.9\\mathrm{e}\\,8$ stars within 5 kpc in our Milky Way sample, the\ncorresponding upper limit on the fraction of stars that could potentially be\n$\\sim$300 K Dyson spheres at 90$\\%$ completion is $\\leq$ $8\\mathrm{e}\\,-4$.",
