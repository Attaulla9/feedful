Like all Apple Silicon-powered Macs, it&#8217;s notably faster, runs quieter, and stays cooler than its Intel-powered predecessor. Although I use the 16-inch MacBook Pro day-to-day, the M1 Mac mini remains a desktop staple for me.</p><p>But the M1 Mac, like all M1-powered machines, leaves room for improvement in important areas like storage, memory, and physical I/O. Watch my latest <a href=\"https://www.9to5mac.com/guides/back-to-the-mac/\">Back to the Mac</a> episode as I explore the state of the Mac mini from both an Intel and Apple Silicon perspective. In it, I share my wishlist of features I&#8217;d like to see in the rumored Mac mini refresh and explore some of the advantages that the Intel Mac mini currently has over the version donning Apple Silicon. I&#8217;ll also take a look at how current Intel Mac mini owners can breathe new life into their existing machines.</p><p> <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/21/back-to-the-mac-my-mac-mini-wish-list-a-look-back-at-the-intel-version-video/#more-786812\" class=\"more-link\">more&#8230;</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/21/back-to-the-mac-my-mac-mini-wish-list-a-look-back-at-the-intel-version-video/\">Back to the Mac: My Mac mini wish list + a look back at the Intel version [Video]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com\">9to5Mac</a>.</p>",
