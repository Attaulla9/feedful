Since its release, many docks have come and gone, but the TS3 Plus remained one of my favorite Thunderbolt accessories. </p><p>Recently <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/08/caldigit-launches-ts4-thunderbolt-dock-18-ports/\">CalDigit released the successor to the TS3 Plus</a>, simply named TS4. Is  a worthy follow-up to the TS3 Plus? As you’ll see in my hands-on, the TS4 is a refined and more capable dock than its predecessor.</p><p> <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/05/caldigit-ts4-review/#more-787244\" class=\"more-link\">more…</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/05/caldigit-ts4-review/\">Hands-on: CalDigit TS4 – the best Thunderbolt dock gets even better [Video]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com\">9to5Mac</a>.</p>",
