Although Instagram didn’t specify the reason, tests were very buggy and users couldn’t properly change different users depending on the Story posted. That said, it’s unlikely that Instagram will release this feature to more countries in the near future.</p><p>Instagram today announced a new test for its Stories function. Starting today, Close Friends will be called Selected People and will let users select exactly who can see some of their Stories for 24 hours.</p><p> <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/15/instagram-changes-close-friends-to-selected-people-in-new-test/#more-757531\" class=\"more-link\">more…</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/15/instagram-changes-close-friends-to-selected-people-in-new-test/\">Instagram changes Close Friends to &#8216;Selected People&#8217; in new test [U: Rolled back]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com\">9to5Mac</a>.</p>",
