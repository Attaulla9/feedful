  "description": " “When the performance of HDFC Bank is compared with ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, we find that the growth that ICICI Bank has displayed in the last six quarters is way higher than HDFC Bank with much lower valuations. So part of the underperformance is coming because of that. Even if Bajaj Finance reports a slightly subdued growth, people take comfort  from the sheer balance sheet size, management pedigree and the kind of platform that they are trying to build.”  ",
