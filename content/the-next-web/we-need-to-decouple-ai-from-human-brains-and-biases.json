Researchers from fields like mathematics, engineering, psychology, economics, and political science got together to find out whether they could describe learning and human thinking so precisely that it could be replicated with a machine. Hardly a decade later, these same scientists contributed to dramatic breakthroughs in robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision. Although a lot of time has passed since then, robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision remain some of the hottest research areas to this day.
