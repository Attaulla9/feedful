The lab was launched with a mission to develop AGI, was cofounded by a researcher who coined the term, and has made some compelling advances in the field. It also recently produced a provocative paper on the subject: “Reward is Enough” The study hypothesizes that AGI could be achieved through a single approach: reinforcement learning. This technique provides feedback in the form of a “reward” — a positive number that tells an algorithm that the action it just performed will benefit its goal. The approach has shown promise in programs such&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/deepmind-reinforcement-learning-only-one-possible-pathway-to-agi?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
