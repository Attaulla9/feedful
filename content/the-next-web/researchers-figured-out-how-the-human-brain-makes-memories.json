Dubbed “Neurons detect cognitive boundaries to structure episodic memories in humans,” the paper essentially lays out a paradigm where “boundary” and “event” cells in the human brain act as markers between specific memories. This means each of our memories are discrete objects, like chunks of chocolate or folders in a filing cabinet. Per the team’s paper: We recorded the activity of single neurons in the human medial temporal&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/researchers-figured-out-how-the-human-brain-makes-memories?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
