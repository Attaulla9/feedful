But many black holes are actually near impossible to detect. Now another team using the Hubble Space Telescope seems to have finally found something nobody has seen before: a black hole which is completely invisible. The research, which has been posted online and submitted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal, is yet to be peer-reviewed. Black holes are what’s left after large stars die and their cores collapse. They are incredibly dense, with gravity so strong that nothing can&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/first-ever-sighting-invisible-black-hole-could-teach-us-how-stars-form-syndication?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
