But as far ebikes are concerned, the Vello Bike+ is about as close to a perpetual motion machine as it gets. Starting at €3,290, it’s a really pricey folding bike, but it does a lot to justify its price. The Vello Bike+ is super lightweight for an ebike at 14kg (31 lb). It has a unique folding mechanism that contorts the bike into a smaller footprint than anything I’ve used other than the Brompton. It uses a fancy Gates Carbon belt and other high-quality components.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/vello-bike-plus-unlimited-range-kinda?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
