Whether it’s EVs, ebikes, or escooters, going rechargeable is the way forward. However, not everything is rosy with this model. For all their green cred, most ebike batteries only last three to seven years, and cannot be easily recycled or their precious materials recovered.   Currently, the glue or welding used in designing battery packs makes it challenging to refurbish or replace cells or components within a battery.  Fortunately, this may change — because a French startup called Gouach has created a new repairable battery for micromobility vehicles.  Gouach’s repairable batteries result in a far lower&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/repairable-batteries-are-critical-to-the-ev-and-ebike-circular-economy?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
