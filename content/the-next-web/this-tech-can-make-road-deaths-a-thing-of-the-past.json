Could we then make zero deaths possible?  The latest research by Neural Propulsion Systems (NPS) thinks so. It posits that new technology can actually enable vehicles to eliminate roadway deaths — with or without human supervision. And we’re not talking about a far-off future where super-smart autonomous vehicles occupy the roads. No, we’re talking about the here and now.  But before&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/this-tech-can-make-road-deaths-thing-of-past?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
