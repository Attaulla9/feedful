Flavor, defined by scientists as the interaction between aroma and taste, is chemically complex. The sugars, acids, and bitter compounds in food interact with the taste receptors on our tongues to invoke taste, while volatile compounds that interact with olfactory receptors in our noses are responsible for aroma. Breeding for flavor is a difficult task for many different reasons. For one, fruit and vegetable plant breeding programs need to improve several&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/your-fruit-is-gonna-get-tastier-and-youve-got-ai-to-thank-for-it?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
