The company announced that, later this year, US merchants will be able to use its handsets as payment terminals. It refers to the function as ‘Tap to Pay.’ The iPhones in question will not only accept Apple Pay, but will also work with other contactless payment types, including American Express, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa cards. All a business needs to do is download the associated app and get going. The NFC reader in the device will do the rest.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-tap-to-pay-feature-smart-analysis?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/company/apple\">Apple</a>",
