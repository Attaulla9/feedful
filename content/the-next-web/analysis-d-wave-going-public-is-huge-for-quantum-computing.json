In doing so, the company will merge with financial corp DPCM to reach a predicted valuation of approximately $1.6 billion. Not too shabby. While D-Wave isn’t the first quantum company to go public — there are several quantum computing stocks on the market — its entry into the NYSE could have far-reaching implications for the quantum computing industry. It’s beyond the scope of this article to discuss the financial ramifications of the deal. Once the ink dries and everything’s approved, that picture will start to come into focus.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/analysis-d-wave-going-public-huge-quantum-computing?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
