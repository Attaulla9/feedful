Our brains have approximately 86 billion neurons. Combined, they make up one of the most advanced organic neural networks known to exist. Current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems attempt to emulate the human brain through the creation of multi-layered neural networks designed to cram as many neurons in as little space as possible. Unfortunately, such designs require massive amounts of power and produce outputs that pale in comparison to the robust, energy-efficient human brain.
