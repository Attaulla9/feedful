We’ve all seen one, held one in our hands, and even tasted one on our tongue (for instance sodium chloride crystals, also known as “salt”). But what on earth is a “time crystal”, if not a sci-fi gadget in the latest Marvel movie? Why do we need a quantum computer to make one? And what is aquantum computer anyway? Bits and qubits Let’s start there. Computers are all around us. Some are compact, portable, and primarily used to stream Netflix, while others fill entire rooms and simulate complex phenomena like the weather or&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/time-crystal-heres-what-the-quantum-system-could-do?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
