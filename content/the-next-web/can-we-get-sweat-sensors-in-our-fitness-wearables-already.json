The levels of these vary depending on a person’s health. Wearable sweat sensors have been developed to track users’ health condition and monitor the levels of these substances (known as analytes) in sweat. Lactate is considered an important biomarker thanks to its involvement in anaerobic metabolism. The undesired accumulation of lactate in muscles can result in fatigue, so changes in the concentration of lactate in sweat can be used to monitor fatigue. At Simon Fraser University’s Additive Manufacturing Laboratory, we have&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/can-we-get-sweat-sensors-in-our-fitness-wearables-already?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
