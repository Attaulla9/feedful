I manipulated the algorithm and made it surface my stories whether they were relevant to specific topics or not. This is a big problem. I’m a regular reporter — a writer. I have no programming skills or formal education in computer science. Google’s arguably the most technologically-advanced AI company in Silicon Valley. It also happens to be worth more than two trillion dollars. Google News reaches almost 300 million users. And I was able to game its algorithms by changing a single word on a web page.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/its-terrifyingly-easy-for-reporters-exploit-googles-news-algorithms?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/company/google\">Google</a>",
