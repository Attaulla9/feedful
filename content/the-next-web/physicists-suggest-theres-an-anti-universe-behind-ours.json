It involves the existence of a mirrored doppelganger called an ‘anti-universe’ where time runs backwards. And it might even be testable. The big idea: What if the universe were a physical object? Current thinking says the Big Bang exploded the universe into existence and it’s been expanding ever since. But the Waterloo team’s work imagines the universe as a space in which the Big Bang occurred. It disputes the long-held&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/physicists-suggest-theres-anti-universe-behind-ours?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
