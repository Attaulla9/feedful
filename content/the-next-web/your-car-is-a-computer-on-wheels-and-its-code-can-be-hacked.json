If you go on Glassdoor, there’s even an interview question, “How many lines of code does a Tesla have?” I’m not entirely sure, but even a decade ago, premium cars contained 100 microprocessor-based electronic control units (ECUs), which collectively executed over 100 million lines of code. Then there’s telematics, driver-assist software, and infotainment system, to name but a few other components that require code. Your car’s infotainment system is just one way that the security of your car can be attacked.
