Well, to be accurate, I have lots of them — but today I’m talking about one in particular: having multiple Apple IDs. I entered the Apple system about 17 years ago, in the days before iCloud and the App Store. I was also a foolish child back then — and my decisions from that time still haunt me in the shape of two separate Apple IDs. One email — which I no longer have access to — is connected to my iTunes and App Store purchases, the other to iCloud. Of course isn’t an overwhelming issue.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/please-let-me-merge-apple-ids?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/company/apple\">Apple</a>",
