In response, a new opportunity for innovation and new business models has emerged: bi-directional charging. But what is it exactly, how does it all work, and how can I get involved? Let’s take a look.  What is bi-directional charging?  Bi-directional charging is the ability for your car battery to receive energy from the electricity grid and be also able to share the power it generates.
