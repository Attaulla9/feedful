Simply put, this is all about using falling or fast-running water to produce electricity. Despite its capability, innovation in hydropower technology has been relatively slow in the last century, and the potential of hydropower in multiple suitable regions remains untapped.  Fortunately for the planet, Julian Hunt, researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), and an international team of scientists have developed a technology that can harness hydropower from steep mountain regions, where the potential for generating electricity from rivers is very high.  What’s&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/how-electric-trucks-can-use-mountains-create-green-energy?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
