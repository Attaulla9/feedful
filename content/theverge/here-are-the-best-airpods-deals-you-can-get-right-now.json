Since Apple launched the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features\">third-gen AirPods</a> in October and unveiled its new lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. What’s more, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen model, despite how recently they launched.</p><p id=\"eJ0Ffb\">Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.</p><aside id=\"Si36Ca\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals\"},{\"title\":\"The best deals on MacBooks right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals\"},{\"title\":\"Which AirPods should you buy?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"VFDHZw\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10742787\"></div></div><h2 id=\"ej2msf\">The best entry-level <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features\">AirPods</a> (second-gen) deals</h2><p id=\"eg29V6\">Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.</p><p id=\"OtXs0h\">At the moment, Apple’s most affordable pair of earbuds are <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently on sale at Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155135/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693\">Target</a> for around $119, which is $30 more than their most recent sale price. </p><div id=\"Evae3q\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9502973\"></div></div><aside id=\"Obm5ev\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best alternatives to Spotify for listening to music\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22910685/music-listening-service-spotify-apple-youtube-amazon\"},{\"title\":\"Apple exploring AirPods that take your temperature and monitor posture: report\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724066/apple-airpods-temperature-posture-hearing-aid-plans\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"eG2fnz\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review\">AirPods (third-gen)</a> deals</h2><p id=\"d2yjBK\">Apple’s newest pair of true wireless earbuds support the company’s MagSafe technology. The short stems make for a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.</p><p id=\"QiPrKN\">Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some worthwhile deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Unfortunately, however, many of the more significant sales have ended and Apple’s third-gen AirPods are only <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available right now at Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230713/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals010422&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422&amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1668152-REG%2Fapple_mme73am_a_airpods_with_charging_case.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo for around $170</a>. The earbuds normally retail for $179, meaning the current sale price is substantially less than their all-time low of $139.99.</p><div id=\"4mr44v\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10744075\"></div></div><h2 id=\"Iewbkw\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation\">AirPods Pro</a> deals</h2><p id=\"S8o5q4\">We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds\">best wireless earbuds</a> an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching\">Apple’s spatial audio</a> feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips.</p><p id=\"bM8uVd\">In October, Apple <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi\">launched a new version</a> of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These retail for $249, but you can <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;subid1=Verge\">buy them right now for $189.99 at Target</a>. That’s not nearly as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still $60 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> also has them on sale, but for slightly more, selling the latest model for $197.</p><div id=\"THtgJp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9513673\"></div></div><aside id=\"gxlsti\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863442/airpods-pro-2-lossless-audio-charging-case-sound\"},{\"title\":\"Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864887/apple-new-airpods-pro-year-of-the-tiger\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"x5NHYH\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features\">AirPods Max</a> deals</h2><p id=\"ESUeUd\">The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\">best noise-canceling headphones</a> for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. </p><div id=\"KBAAwB\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10361602\"></div></div><p id=\"irGZgJ\">Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 on Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently on sale in several styles at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> for $449.99, one of their better prices to date (discount applies at checkout). You can also <a href=\"https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=airpods+max\">buy them in various colors at Micro Center for $439.99</a>, though they’re only available for in-store pickup in select cities and states.</p><aside id=\"Mpx47T\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside><p id=\"0mvFWM\"></p>",
