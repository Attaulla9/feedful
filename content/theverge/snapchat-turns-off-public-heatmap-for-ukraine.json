The company says that the move is “a safety precaution” and that there will still be a curated public feed of snaps submitted by Ukrainians.</p><p id=\"v7cK6Z\">Normally, <a href=\"https://map.snapchat.com\">the Snap Map</a> displays a color code to show how many people are posting public images in an area. In practice, that means you can get a good idea of where Snapchat users are concentrated. While this publicly available data isn’t usually meaningful (it’s not a surprise that more people are posting from downtown Seattle than the nearby national forest), <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954857/russia-invades-ukraine-news-updates\">in a wartime scenario</a> where Russia may want to track evacuations or citizen movements, it’s probably for the best that the feature is turned off.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"YAC0wj\"><q>Companies are being careful in the region</q></aside></div><p id=\"7HA76Q\">Other companies have taken similar actions to make Ukrainians’ movements harder to track — Google <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954426/google-disables-maps-traffic-data-in-ukraine-to-protect-citizens\">turned off live traffic information</a> in Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22957000/apple-russia-ukraine-invasion-halt-product-sales-app-store\">as did Apple</a>. Snap has also taken a few additional actions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/we-support-ukraine\">a news post from the company</a>, it’s stopped showing ads in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, and won’t sell ad spots to Russian entities. </p>",
