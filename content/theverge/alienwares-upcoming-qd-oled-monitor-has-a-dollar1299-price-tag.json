The Dell-owned company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855531/alienware-curved-34-inch-qd-oled-samsung-gaming-monitor-specs\">debuted the monitor (AW3423DW) at CES</a> this year and will start shipping it out this spring.</p><div id=\"mydCmL\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We're excited to announce that the Alienware 34 QD-OLED Gaming Display will arrive early this Spring for $1,299 USD. <br><br>In addition, the Alienware Tri-Mode Wireless Gaming Headset (AW920H) is also set to arrive early Spring for $199 USD. <a href=\"https://t.co/C4QoIGfjea\">pic.twitter.com/C4QoIGfjea</a></p>— ALIENWARE (@Alienware) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alienware/status/1492271181982060551?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 11, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"XfIlfe\">While the price isn’t exactly low, it’s still cheaper than some of the standard OLED monitors currently on the market. For example, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LG-32EP950-B-Ultrafine-Display-DCI-P3/dp/B097NYL7XS?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LG’s 32-inch Ultrafine UHD OLED monitor</a>, while not exactly ideal for gaming, will run you $3,999. Alienware’s 55-inch OLED gaming monitor currently sits at $2,719 on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-Gaming-Monitor-True-Life/dp/B07YSVF47Q?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20811828/dell-alienware-55-oled-gaming-monitor-release-date-pricing\">was first released in 2019</a> for $3,999 — size is obviously a factor here, but it’s still nice to see a monitor that wields new QD-OLED tech sitting well below the $2,000 mark.</p><div><div id=\"VNyuSZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10961963\"></div></div></div><p id=\"DqwIFS\">Alienware’s QD-OLED monitor comes with all the advantages of an OLED monitor, including deep blacks and bold contrast. Throwing Quantum Dot technology in the mix makes for higher brightness levels with more vibrant colors — the monitor should claim 99.3 percent of the DCI-P3 color space. It also has a resolution of 3440 x 1440 resolution, a 175Hz refresh rate, as well as 250 nits brightness with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876061/samsung-qd-oled-quantum-dot-tv-panels-sgs-certification-brightness-color-viewing-angles\">a max of 1,000 nits</a>. You can also expect a fast 0.1ms response rate, and support for Nvidia’s G-Sync Ultimate technology.</p><p id=\"vmhsC6\">The $1,299 price tag on this Alienware monitor gives us a hint at the sort of pricing we can expect for other products using Samsung’s QD-OLED tech. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer\">Sony’s expected to release the first-ever QD-OLED 4K TV</a> later this year, and it’ll be interesting to find out how much it costs.</p><p id=\"TiuvbL\"><em><strong>Correction February 13th, 9:25pm ET: </strong></em><em>Alienware’s QD-OLED monitor has a resolution of 3440 x 1440, not 3440 x 1400. We regret the error. </em></p>",
