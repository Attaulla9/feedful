You can watch anime on your Switch in docked, tabletop, or handheld mode while premium subscribers can watch shows offline, making it perfect for long trips. Hopefully, it will be a much improved experience versus the Crunchyroll app on other platforms. The Apple TV version is particularly excruciating to use.</p><p id=\"XGKIHC\">Even with the addition of Crunchyroll, there still aren’t too many streaming services available on the Switch. So far, the console lags behind PlayStation and Xbox offering only <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/11/16633818/nintendo-switch-hulu-app-perfectly-good-streaming-gadget\">Hulu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776560/twitch-app-nintendo-switch-launch\">YouTube, Twitch</a>, and, exclusively in Japan, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15957198/nintendo-switch-video-streaming-app-niconico-release-date\">Niconico</a>.</p><p id=\"NCXGSL\">There’s still no word on when Netflix will finally be added to the Switch. In the past, Nintendo has said it’s amenable <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/8/14852624/nintendo-switch-netflix-hulu-amazon-support\">to bringing the streaming service to the console</a>, but that hasn’t yet materialized. For now, between the roguelike <em>Hades</em> and the addition of Crunchyroll, Switch users can finally have <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Tlwda9S58Lg\">the power of god <em>and</em> anime</a> on their side. </p>",
