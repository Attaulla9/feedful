Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856031/tcl-30-v-5g-30-xe-5g-t-mobile-verizon\">TCL 30 XE 5G and TCL 30 V 5G</a> announced earlier this year for the US market, the five new handsets are focused on Europe, and their starting prices range from €139 to €249. </p><p id=\"vfLNqB\">At the top of the new lineup is the TCL 30 5G, the only one of the new phones to support 5G. It’s got a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display with a 13-megapixel selfie camera in a small teardrop notch, and around back it has a trio of cameras including a 50-megapixel main camera, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. It’s powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset with a 5,010mAh battery, and will be priced starting at €249 when it goes on sale in Europe in April.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpkYoKFi0mW39PqzfmFLCF9rNa0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23268780/T30_5G_5.jpg\">      <cite>Image: TCL</cite>      <figcaption><em>The TCL 30 5G sits at the top of the lineup.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"cNTelI\">Next up are the €199 TCL 30 Plus and €179 TCL 30. Both have the same 6.7-inch display and triple camera setup as the TCL 30 5G, but as their names suggest, they’re not 5G capable. The TCL 30 specifically also has a lower-resolution 8-megapixel selfie camera. Both are powered by a MediaTek Helio G37 processor, with 5,010mAh batteries, and are available now in Europe. </p><div><div class=\"c-image-grid\"><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBqh-1XzJiOuTxbyZ89zzh4siCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23268783/T30_2.jpg\">      <cite>Image: TCL</cite>      <figcaption><em>The TCL 30.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1aKLPREQtR0np_q-fKKGJybFLs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23268787/T30__5.jpg\">      <cite>Image: TCL</cite>      <figcaption><em>The TCL 30 Plus.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div></div></div><p id=\"Vu8jWD\">At the bottom of the lineup are the €149 TCL 30 SE and €139 TCL 30 E. They have smaller and lower-resolution 6.52-inch 720p displays, less powerful Helio G25 processors, and the  TCL 30 E also lacks the 2-megapixel macro camera found on the rest of the lineup. But even these lower-cost handsets still include 5,000mAh batteries, use USB-C rather than older Micro USB connections, and, like the rest of the lineup, will ship with Android 12. The 30 SE is available now, while the 30 E will ship in Europe in April. </p><div><div class=\"c-image-grid\"><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j9jsfk1nmD8afFHDm963gGxV-Kk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23268791/T30SE_4.jpg\">      <cite>Image: TCL</cite>      <figcaption><em>The TCL 30 SE.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6y7q7LTPWT_npuRzaUBvWxGM4Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23268793/T30E_4.jpg\">      <cite>Image: TCL</cite>      <figcaption><em>The TCL 30 E.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div></div></div><p id=\"4EbJvp\">When TCL announced its first two 30 Series handsets in January, it said that it planned to launch a total of eight phones around the world over the course of 2022. With today’s announcement, seven of these eight phones are now public, with only a successor to last year’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22560849/tcl-20-pro-5g-review-screen-battery-price-specs\">TCL 20 Pro</a> unaccounted for. </p>",
