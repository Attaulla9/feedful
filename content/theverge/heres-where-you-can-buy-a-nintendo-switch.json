The speakers get a bit louder and offer a touch more clarity, too, and there’s a wired ethernet port built directly into the dock.</p><p id=\"ThJrec\">While the supply is <em>starting</em> to catch up with demand, the Switch OLED model can still be relatively difficult to come by.

However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.</p><div id=\"jnXhNd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9556339\"></div></div><p id=\"9sHCpf\">First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage, especially with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes. At Amazon, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">400GB microSD card will currently set you back $44.99</a>, which is 36 percent off the typical price retail price.

The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some <em>Mario Party</em> titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro Controller, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgdocaWxzJq\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> all currently have the controller available for around $69, which is the full MSRP.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"UODwlY\">Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover.

Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.
