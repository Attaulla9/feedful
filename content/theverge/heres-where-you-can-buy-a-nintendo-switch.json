The Lite only functions as a handheld console — meaning you can’t hook it up to your TV — and it’s smaller, lighter, and sturdier than its dockable counterpart. It also features a D-pad and can play all the same games, except those that require detachable Joy-Con controllers (which are very few). Regardless, it's a great handheld system for those who prefer to game on the go.</p><ul><li id=\"CEr672\">Amazon, Best Buy, and most other major retailers all currently carry the Nintendo Switch Lite as a standalone console, though, colors are limited. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Yellow/dp/B07V4GCFP9?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Yellow/dp/B07V4GCFP9?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">turquoise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Yellow/dp/B084Y3VVNG/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pink models</a> for $199.99, its usual MSRP, and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Console-Coral%2F486376323&amp;subid1=TheVergeWhereToFindSwitch242022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-coral%2F-%2FA-79574296&amp;subid1=TheVergeWhereToFindSwitch242022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target are selling the pink version</a> for the same price. <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgyYWA0908Y\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy is selling both the turquoise</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgy0Hi8vs1J\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pink models</a> for $199.99, too, and GameStop has <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=TheVergeWhereToBuySwitch242022&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-console-dialga-and-palkia-edition%2F11156557.html%3Fdwvar_11156557_condition%3DNew%26dwvar_11156557_color%3Dblack\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the black, <em>Pokémon</em>-inspired edition</a> for the same price.</li><li id=\"BmFz39\">Amazon, meanwhile, is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Yellow/dp/B07VGC3WCZ?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Switch Lite alongside a 64GB SanDisk microSD card for $214.38, a $5 discount</a>.

However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.</p><div id=\"jnXhNd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9556339\"></div></div><p id=\"9sHCpf\">First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage, especially with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes. At Amazon, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">400GB microSD card will currently set you back $39.99</a>, which is 43 percent off the typical price retail price.

The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some <em>Mario Party</em> titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro Controller, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgdocaWxzJq\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> all currently have the controller available for around $69, which is basically the full MSRP.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"UODwlY\">Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.
