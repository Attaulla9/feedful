What’s more, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/4347665658888576968\">Valve has announced today</a> that it’s making good on its promise to sell replacement parts for the Steam Deck so you can repair it yourself, and it has made iFixit the first authorized seller of parts for both the new Deck and the existing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today\">Valve Index</a> VR headset.</p><p id=\"SELRHs\">Unfortunately, Valve isn’t yet saying which parts will be available — when I asked if the Deck’s screen and battery might be among them, Steam Deck designer Lawrence Yang told me it’s still working with iFixit to hammer the details out. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUi0CHHjHK57lnNeCuY_gfYcrUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23247619/steam_deck_creative_electron_ifixit.gif\">  </figure><p id=\"JIHLVR\">But it might not be too surprising if those key components aren’t made available right away since iFixit’s teardown shows they’re among the hardest to remove.</p><p id=\"YA4blR\">In the video teardown, iFixit praises many elements of the Steam Deck’s repairability, like how it takes just three screws to easily replace each thumbstick or a single screw and a slip-on EMI shield to replace the SSD. </p><p id=\"omVPN3\">But the screen has a bit of adhesive that’ll mean you’ll need careful application of heat and some suction cups — and the battery looks even harder to dislodge. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qdyqGRQHrqXi84Z68TvvBkBVudQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23247645/steam_deck_ifixit_ssd.jpg\">      <cite>Image: iFixit</cite>      <figcaption><em>SSD replacement looks easier </em><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713075/valve-steam-deck-teardown-repair-open\" target=\"_blank\"><em>than Valve initially let on</em></a><em>, though you’ll need a single-sided M.2 2230 and it’s unclear if the 64GB Steam Deck comes with a shield.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"BUG6RN\">“Battery replacements definitely seem to be the Steam Deck’s Achilles heel,” says iFixit’s video narrator, repeatedly attacking the adhesive with flat scraping tools and eventually managing to pry the 40.04Wh, 7.7V, 5313mAh pack out.</p><p id=\"9bq4M0\">iFixit also shows off the handheld’s magnesium internal frame, some unusual springs that give the touchpads some physical clickability, and the wires that power the touchpads atop each stick (which can let you activate gyro aiming in games without taking your thumbs off the sticks; it’s pretty neat).</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LJ_-TVaU5b-AucdSqHDn5Z4NDc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23247647/ifixit_touchpad_springs.jpg\">      <cite>Image: iFixit</cite>      <figcaption><em>The springs behind the touchpads are unusual.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"REjb4b\">Want even more visibility inside the Steam Deck?
