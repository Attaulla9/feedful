Google Chat should not be confused with GChat, the unofficial name for Google Talk, which was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15051272/google-talk-gchat-replaced-hangouts-messaging-gmail\">officially killed off in 2017</a> and replaced with — you guessed it — Hangouts.</p><aside id=\"SeaEim\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"A very brief history of every Google messaging app\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"CDrz6U\">Existing Hangouts conversation histories will carry over into Chat except in “a few special cases,” Google says. Although it’s not possible to opt out of this transition, Google adds that the hangouts.google.com domain will continue to work.</p><p id=\"7B3EuY\">For now, this change is only affecting Workspace users, as well as legacy G Suite Basic and Business customers. In other words, it’s impacting people who use Google’s services as part of a business or organization. But <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/02/22/google-chat-hangouts-workspace/\"><em>9to5Google </em>notes</a> that Google has previously indicated free Google Account users will go through the same transition after Workspace.</p>",
