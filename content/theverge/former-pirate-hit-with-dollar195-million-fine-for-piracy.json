In its heyday, TVAddons was a site that allowed users to upload unofficial add-ons for Kodi, the open-source media library you can install on streaming devices like the Amazon Fire TV Stick and Google Chromecast. While Kodi itself is legal software, third-party apps, like TVAddons, can direct people to pirated content.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"RTgDdg\"><q>Canadian telecom giants filed the lawsuit in 2017</q></aside></div><p id=\"UxeMZJ\">A copy of the judgment (<a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/images/T-800-17-Judgment_BELL-CANADA-ET-AL-v-ADAM-LACKMAN-ET-AL_23-FEB-2022.pdf\">PDF</a>) ruled that the Montreal-based Lackman “directly or indirectly” participated “in the development, hosting, distribution or promotion of Kodi add-ons that provide users with unauthorized access” to copyrighted content.</p><p id=\"Zcm6Xt\">Some of the biggest telecom providers in Canada, including Bell Canada, TVA, Videotron, and Rogers, first filed the lawsuit against Lackman in 2017 — which even <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tvaddons-piracy-rogers-bell-videotron-court-1.4231340\">involved a raid of Lackman’s home</a> —  as part of a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15791688/hbo-netflix-hollywood-ace-fight-piracy\">broader crackdown on pirated content</a>. Around the same time, Lackman <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/dish-network-sues-zemtv-and-tv-addons-for-copyright-infringement-170605/\">was sued by satellite television provider Dish</a> in the US for copyright infringement. He <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/tvaddons-and-dish-network-settle-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-180826/\">reached a settlement with the company in 2018</a>, requiring TVAddons to prioritize Dish’s copyright complaints.</p><div id=\"5ov7fi\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The lawsuit is now officially over and I can move on with my life. It wasn't the outcome I had hoped for, but an outcome nonetheless.<br><br>I won't be making further statements on the matter, as I wish to I look towards the future rather than dwell upon the past.</p>— Adam Lackman • אדם לקמן (@adam_lackman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adam_lackman/status/1496561255628345348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"q5eUAb\">“The lawsuit is now officially over and I can move on with my life,” Lackman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adam_lackman/status/1496561255628345348\">said in a tweet</a>. “It wasn’t the outcome I had hoped for, but an outcome nonetheless.”</p><p id=\"xgx6MD\">Although TVAddons had a solid fanbase at one point — amounting to about <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/tvaddons-returns-ugly-war-canadian-telcos-kodi-addons-170801/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CApproximately%2040%20million%20unique%20users,ons%20to%20access%20television%20content.\">40 million active users</a> per month in 2017 — many took issues with some of its shadier practices. As <a href=\"https://kinkeadtech.com/tvaddons-indigo-deactivating-addons/\"><em>Kinkead Tech</em></a> points out (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Addons4Kodi/comments/e9zq3g/tvaddons_strikes_again/\">and a</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Addons4Kodi/comments/htnof9/a_weird_addon_called_indigo_appeared_from_nowhere/\">number</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Addons4Kodi/comments/lmbk5q/why_does_tvaddons_disable_the_crew/\">of Reddit users</a>), TVAddons would sometimes auto-install the Indigo add-on, which apparently blocked the use of certain other add-ons and repositories, as well as launched a pesky ad for a VPN service when opening Kodi. The lawsuit also addresses this — it prohibits Lackman from “participating in the development, operation, maintenance, updating, hosting, distribution or promotion or Infringing Add-ons,” including Indigo and FreeTelly.</p><p id=\"TRTEQW\">In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/9k7pya/tv-addons-sued-by-rogers-bell-fairplay-members\"><em>Vice</em> in 2018</a>, Lackman noted that he wanted TVAddons to be a hub for legal content — he said it was supposed to contain apps that scrape content from free but legal platforms like PlutoTV. Despite this, Lackman told <em>Vice </em>he didn’t really police the add-ons that were uploaded on his site, which inevitability led to pirated user-generated content.</p><p id=\"Lztvdi\">Over the years, apps that house pirated content like TVAddons <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/kodi-is-sick-of-pirate-addons-but-banning-them-is-not-an-option-190926/\">have given Kodi a reputation for piracy</a>, with a lot of people I know personally who wrongly think the software is downright illegal — because let’s face it, who doesn’t know someone who has (or had) a hacked Fire Stick with Kodi on it? Heck, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176894/google-removes-kodi-search-autocomplete-anti-piracy\">even Google banned</a> search autocomplete for the word “Kodi.” According to data compiled by <a href=\"https://www.comparitech.com/kodi/kodi-piracy-decline/\">Comparitech</a>, Google searches for “Kodi” are actually on the decline, likely due to cases like this and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/26/15433342/eu-court-of-justice-filmspeler-kodi-piracy-box-ruling\">Europe’s ban on the sale of streaming boxes with piracy software</a>. As <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/kodi-addon-build-repositories-shut-down-citing-legal-pressure-191114/\">legal</a> <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4562642/Three-Kodi-add-ons-close-legal-threats.html\">pressure</a> continues to mount, Kodi pirates may have jumped ship, but they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20697751/piracy-plex-netflix-hulu-streaming-wars\">have found a new vessel to sail through Plex</a>, a fellow descendant of Xbox Media Center.</p>",
