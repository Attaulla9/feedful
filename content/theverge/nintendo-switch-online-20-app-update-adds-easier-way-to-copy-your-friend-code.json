The app launched <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15995098/nintendo-switch-online-app-out-now-ios-android\">shortly after the Nintendo Switch in 2017</a>. It’s designed to work in tandem with the console, offering features like online voice chat that aren’t available on the Switch itself. </p><p id=\"Zr7GvV\">For my money, the 2.0 update’s most interesting improvement is that it offers an easier way to find and share your friend code, the cumbersome 12-digit identifier that’s the primary way of adding friends on Nintendo’s online service. Instead of having to manually copy out the code <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-View-or-Change-Your-Friend-Code-1497995.html\">from your Switch console itself</a> before sharing it with a friend, the update lets you easily copy it from the app with a single tap. Your friend will still have to manually type out the 12 digits to add you on their console, but at least sharing the code is now easier. </p><p id=\"8YnmaF\">The other updates available with the 2.0 update are more minor. Nintendo advertises that the app now shows which friends are online, and also lets you “change your online-status settings.” These are both such basic features that it’s amazing they weren’t already available in an app that launched <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15995098/nintendo-switch-online-app-out-now-ios-android\">almost five years ago</a>, but it’s not a huge surprise given Nintendo’s traditional focus on single- and local-multiplayer games.</p><p id=\"41e4TN\"></p><p id=\"i4QVnK\"></p><p id=\"RgznGd\"></p>",
