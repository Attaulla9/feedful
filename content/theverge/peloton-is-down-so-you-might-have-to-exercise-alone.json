On Twitter, the company said this may also impact users’ ability to access Peloton’s websites. However, as of this writing, the only Peloton site suffering a major outage is the member profile/workout history page. According to <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/status/peloton/\">DownDetector</a>, people began reporting Peloton outages at around 10AM ET.</p><p id=\"arYF8f\">While the outage isn’t necessarily Peloton’s fault, it does highlight one of the pitfalls of connected fitness. Without software and connectivity, the expensive hardware you just bought <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/peloton-s-new-tread-problem-is-a-reminder-that-you-don-1847149583\">suddenly isn’t quite as useful</a>. Peloton users on Twitter seem to be taking it in stride, with many opting to use the “Just Run” or “Just Ride” option. That said, as Peloton’s new CEO, Barry McCarthy, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22942449/pelotons-new-ceo-subscriptions-open-app-store-barry-mccarthy\">emphasized over the weekend</a>, content and the on-screen experience are the company’s bread and butter. </p><p id=\"BpVkyP\">Of course, Peloton will eventually be back online. But in the meantime, you might have to just exercise without a leaderboard. </p><div id=\"57DIrI\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are currently investigating an issue with Peloton services. This may impact your ability to take classes or access pages on the web. <br><br>We apologize for any impact this may have on your workout and appreciate your patience. Please check <a href=\"https://t.co/Dxcht2tQB0\">https://t.co/Dxcht2tQB0</a> for updates.</p>— Peloton (@onepeloton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/onepeloton/status/1496155772690051080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>",
