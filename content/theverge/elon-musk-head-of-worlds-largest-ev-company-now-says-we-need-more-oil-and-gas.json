He’s likely referring to the world’s notable dependence on Russian pipelines — a dependence which hasn’t stopped many governments from sanctioning Russia <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954857/russia-invades-ukraine-news-updates\">following its invasion of Ukraine</a>, but has sparked fears over surging energy prices, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/why-europe-depends-on-russia-for-natural-gas.html\">particularly in Europe</a>.</p><p id=\"T3bCpm\">It is <em>always</em> hard to tell if Musk is just riffing, trolling, or actually putting plans into action when he posts things to Twitter, but there’s no denying he’s incredibly influential and many of his 76 million followers take him seriously even when joking. </p><p id=\"eFv11x\">It’s not like oil and gas aren’t important for Musk’s plans as well. We reported last year on how his <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22245363/spacex-texas-oil-company-drill-natural-gas-lone-star\">SpaceX wanted to drill for natural gas </a>on land near its Starship facilities in Texas. Electricity doesn’t get Musk’s rockets off the ground.</p><p id=\"9YJjhm\">“I’m not in favor of demonizing the oil and gas industry,” <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280410/elon-musk-joe-biden-carbon-tax\">Musk told Joe Rogan on a podcast last year</a>. “We’re gonna need to burn fossil fuels for a long time. The question is just at what rate do we move to a sustainable energy future?”</p>",
