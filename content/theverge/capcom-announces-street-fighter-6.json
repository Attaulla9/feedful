A brief teaser trailer was following the season final of the Capcom Pro Tour, where Kawano defeated veteran Daigo Umehara.</p><p id=\"5pshpT\">The trailer doesn’t show any actual gameplay, but it suggests that <em>Street Fighter 6</em> will have a more realistic art style than previous games in the series — at least, as realistic as you could expect while maintaining Ryu’s formidable proportions. Capcom says more information on the game will be coming this summer.</p><p id=\"SHxuwH\">Capcom will be hoping that <em>Street Fighter 6</em> has a better launch than its predecessor. <em>Street Fighter V</em> looked and played great <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/23/11098522/street-fighter-5-review-interview-capcom\">when it came out</a> for PS4 and PC in 2016, but it suffered from a dearth of content as well as bugs and server issues. The game ultimately sold more than six million copies after subsequent revisions <em>Arcade Edition</em> and <em>Champion Edition</em> were met with a better reception.</p><div id=\"SLme8q\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Capcom Fighting Collection brings together 10 classic fighters with Online Rollback Netcode, coming June 24th, 2022!<br><br>  Darkstalkers (all five games!)<br>  Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix<br>  Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo<br>  Red Earth<br>... and more!<br><br> ️ <a href=\"https://t.co/prOT8yT6Xz\">https://t.co/prOT8yT6Xz</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7HbE8nt1G0\">pic.twitter.com/7HbE8nt1G0</a></p>— Street Fighter (@StreetFighter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1495634283142135808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 21, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"hqk8kA\">Capcom also announced a new compilation of ten fighting games for the PS4, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch. <em>Capcom Fighting Collection</em> will be out on June 24th and includes the following titles: </p><ul><li id=\"IyTaMF\"><em>Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors</em></li><li id=\"7ExJVC\"><em>Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge</em></li><li id=\"stlUfC\"><em>Vampire Hunter 2: Darkstalkers’ Revenge</em></li><li id=\"09crbN\"><em>Vampire Savior: The Lord of Vampire</em></li><li id=\"RLfD1L\"><em>Vampire Savior 2: The Lord of Vampire</em></li><li id=\"P54XjT\"><em>Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition</em></li><li id=\"hC7vsX\"><em>Red Earth</em></li><li id=\"Jdfuok\"><em>Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix (Pocket Fighter)</em></li><li id=\"murnkC\"><em>Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness</em></li><li id=\"qQOZKj\"><em>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo</em></li></ul>",
