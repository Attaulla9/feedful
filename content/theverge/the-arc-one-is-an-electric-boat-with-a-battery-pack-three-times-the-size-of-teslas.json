The company has raised <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798574/arc-30-million-eclipse-ventures-raise-series-a-funding\">$30 million from a group of prominent investors</a> that include Will Smith, Kevin Durant, and Sean “Diddy” Combs. </p><p id=\"J587wn\">The company has already tested an early prototype, and the reveal of its pre-production version is meant to send the signal that the company is getting closer to customer deliveries, which are on schedule for this summer. </p><div id=\"z2wysx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11075474\"></div></div><p id=\"AtwtFS\">The specs of the Arc One have changed slightly since the company first <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598790/arc-one-electric-boat-photos-interview\">came out of stealth </a>last year. The boat will still have a top speed of around 40 miles per hour and can last about four hours under power before needing to be recharged — which the startup claims is plenty for a day out on the water. </p><p id=\"wplJ7j\">But instead of a 200kWh battery pack capable of powering an electric motor with at least 475 horsepower, the boat will come with a 220kWh pack capable of powering a motor with over 500 horsepower. That makes the Arc One’s battery pack three times the size of a Tesla Model Y, said Arc CEO Mitch Lee. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"Pb7gRu\"><q>“It’s a lot”</q></aside></div><p id=\"3LLT3j\">“It’s a lot,” Lee said in an interview. “It’s actually split into two packs.”</p><p id=\"QIDJLM\">Unlike with cars, a heavy battery pack is not a drawback for an electric boat, Lee argued. “The more a boat weighs, generally the more stable it is,” he said. “Especially for the water sports market, heavier boats means that you can throw a wake for somebody to wakeboard behind.” </p><div id=\"SF190H\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/680670956?h=7fc29cccc5&amp;app_id=122963&amp;byline=0&amp;badge=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"n4kxS7\">Lee said the Arc One will be a limited edition luxury cruise that will retail for $300,000. The company is hoping to follow in Tesla’s footsteps by selling a high-priced, low-volume boat from which it will use the revenues to fund the production of a lower-cost model. </p><p id=\"AajV7b\">“It’s premium, and it only appeals to a subset of people,” he said. “We want to get into the Model S-type of price range where it’s premium to the market.”</p><p id=\"ViMYmL\">That could include other water sport vehicles, like jet skis, or even commercial vessels, like ferries, Lee said. “That is absolutely what we have in mind.”</p>",
