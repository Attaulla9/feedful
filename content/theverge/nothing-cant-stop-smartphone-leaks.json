Now, a very similar, if not <em>the very same image</em>, has been publicly posted to Twitter by prolific and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1500833087948836873\">reliable leaker Evan Blass</a>.</p><p id=\"PhHIDE\">Everything about this photo screams “tech trade show.” There’s the slick modern decoration, the pristine carpets, the reusable water bottle kept close at hand, and, of course, the unmistakable sign of pristine white sneakers worn with skinny jeans and a jacket. <em>TechCrunch</em> reported that the photo it saw was taken at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, and you know what? I believe it. </p><div id=\"p3nM0F\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing to see here. <a href=\"https://t.co/mzLeTVHSXm\">pic.twitter.com/mzLeTVHSXm</a></p>— Ev (@evleaks) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1500833087948836873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"DjZuOh\">But enough about the room — let’s take a closer look at the phone itself. </p><p id=\"RoYQEe\">Enhance: </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_1oxr90u-r8YU8OVMdbKx587mA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23294863/nothing_1.jpg\">      <cite>Image: @Evleaks</cite>      <figcaption><em>Enhance.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"K2SlHE\">Enhance!</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOUYSziJIjdxrADQBYrxyFEGUf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23294869/nothing_2.jpg\">      <cite>Image: @Evleaks</cite>      <figcaption><em>Enhance.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"ZQrjR1\">ENHANCE!</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FIpxfrHGJXt1RSv5boXAshBP8PM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23294870/nothing_3.jpg\">      <cite>Image: @Evleaks</cite>      <figcaption><em>Enhance.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"mvomPZ\">Yep, sure looks like a smartphone to me. <em>TechCrunch</em> reports that we might see it officially announced by next month and that it’ll include “elements of transparency” in its design. But I’ll be damned if there’s anything more we can glean about the phone itself from the blurry picture above (though, please, prove me wrong in the comments). </p><p id=\"1yzI1Q\">As a recap, Nothing launched its first product, a pair of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs\">true wireless earbuds</a>, last year. But from the beginning, Pei has been clear that he plans for it to produce <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices\">a whole ecosystem of devices</a>. A smartphone would be a logical part of that ecosystem, although I’ll be interested in seeing what the company is able to achieve after having only existed for a little over a year.</p>",
