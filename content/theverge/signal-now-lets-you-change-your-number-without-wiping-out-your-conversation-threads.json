Then, head over to the new “Change Phone Number” option under Signal’s account settings, where you’ll be asked to enter in both the old and new numbers. Lastly, Signal will guide you through the <a href=\"https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318691\">usual registration process</a> for setting up a phone number with one of its accounts. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KTVicILN5SeriX1HFaoSDa9JreQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23224753/change_number_product.png\">  </figure><p id=\"KFVQN9\">Once you’ve successfully updated your number, contacts you’ve been chatting with in Signal will see a new message inline in your thread that notes that you’ve changed their phone number, along with a helpful link to update your contact card accordingly. Crucially, though, you won’t lose your existing thread or groups that you’re already a part of. </p><p id=\"8VXV3c\">The new feature is intended for users who are keeping their current phone but getting a new phone number — if you’re just upgrading to a new phone and want to keep all your stuff, you’ll need to use <a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/ios-device-transfer/\">Signal’s local data transfer feature</a> to send over your data from your old device to a new one. </p><p id=\"i0a2u4\"></p><p id=\"SNGWHu\"></p>",
