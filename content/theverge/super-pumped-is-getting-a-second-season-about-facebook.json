(Perhaps Showtime will bring Jesse Eisenberg back to reprise his role from <em>The Social Network</em>?) </p><p id=\"BtE5NR\">It seems that the relationship between the two Facebook (now Meta) leaders will be foundational to the coming season, as <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/showtime-renews-super-pumped-season-2-facebook/\"><em>Entertainment Weekly</em> reports</a> that it’s subtitled <em>Sheryl &amp; Mark. </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/business/mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg-facebook.html\">If a 2021 <em>The New York Times</em> article</a> about Zuckerberg and Sandberg is anything to go on, there could be a lot of potential material to include.</p><p id=\"IwYc4r\">Season one of <em>Super Pumped</em>, which debuts on February 27th, is based on a book by <em>The New York Times’</em> Mike Isaac. Season two is also based on an Isaac-authored book, though that one isn’t out yet. </p><aside id=\"ftppXd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Super Pumped gets a new, longer teaser with more Uber shenanigans\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877447/super-pumped-season-one-teaser-trailer-uber-travis-kalanick-showtime\"},{\"title\":\"Watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt as former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in new TV show teaser\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2021/12/23/22851481/uber-showtime-series-super-pumped-trailer-joseph-gordon-levitt\"}]}'></div></aside>",
