In a PR stunt cleverly disguised as Savathûn hijacking the <em>Destiny 2</em> Twitter account, the titular Witch Queen shot off some fire tweets, excoriating anyone foolish enough to wander into her mentions. </p><p id=\"1tfzGV\">Savathûn started her social media takeover with the tweet, “I am unburdened—hollow, filled only with potential. Weightless. Pure,” which, honestly, is a mood. When the official Xbox account replied somewhat snarkily, Savathûn unleashed all four barrels of <a href=\"https://www.destinypedia.com/The_Fourth_Horseman\">The Fourth Horseman</a>, kicking off her short but brilliant Twitter career.</p><div id=\"iooVlc\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Being flawless is only difficult when you are flawed.</p>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1494049077851734017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"IUfqi3\">Savathûn was no respecter of persons, neither player nor journalist was spared from her toxic tweeting as demonstrated by this brutal own of <em>Forbes</em> journalist Paul Tassi.</p><div id=\"opymBX\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mm, it’s so good to stand and stretch. Run my fingers through the grass. You should give it a try!</p>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1494102857917911041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 17, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"A6sujy\">If an eldritch Cthullian horror told <em>me</em> to touch grass, I would first, touch grass, and secondly, expire on the spot. </p><p id=\"U60xyB\"><em>Destiny 2</em> players used the direct line to the Witch Queen to ask questions about the lore, and some of Savathûn’s meaner tweets were her answers.</p><div id=\"jLJfC3\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That sweet spark. Osiris’s mind screamed her name when I stepped over her broken shell.</p>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1494044976015052800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"fxRYIz\">When she wasn’t reading the entire <em>D2</em> Twitter community for filth, Savathûn’s posts were almost philosophical, giving some insight into the creature Guardians will fight once the expansion launches next week. The stunt ended with a tweet from the <em>Destiny 2</em> social team saying essentially, “Uhh, I think we were hacked?”</p><p id=\"EhCxW9\">Despite being the villain of <em>The Witch Queen</em> expansion, Savathûn has fans who didn’t want to let the roast-a-thon end there. A <em>Destiny 2</em> clan went the extra mile of paying for a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678456/cameo-calls-live-app-chat-celebrities-meet-and-greet\">Cameo</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debra_Wilson\">Debra Wilson</a>, Savathûn’s legendary voice actress, <a href=\"https://imp.i309903.net/c/482924/828354/11642?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cameo.com%2Frecipient%2F620d2ba29236a6cb6365d463&amp;sharedid=theverge.com\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to give an in-character shoutout</a>.</p><p id=\"vqq6mc\">I am not a <em>Destiny 2</em> player. Although I enthusiastically consume its lore and enjoy some of the characters (Hey Zaddy-vala!), I find the game itself so impenetrable that I’ve repeatedly bounced right off it. However, I am <em>all in</em> on <em>The Witch Queen</em> for one reason alone: Savathûn. You must understand, I am a woman of simple tastes, I see a big, monstrous lady who wants to end all life who is also voiced by Debra THEE Wilson, I simp. </p><p id=\"k1uuhi\"></p>",
