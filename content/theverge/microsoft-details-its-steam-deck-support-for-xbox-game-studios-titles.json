Most Xbox Game Studios titles will run on the Steam Deck, but Microsoft says <em>Gears 5</em>, <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>, <em>Halo Infinite</em>, and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator X </em>are unsupported. These titles don’t work on the Steam Deck due to anti-cheat systems, and it’s not clear if they’ll ever be supported in the future.</p><p id=\"GpCkUI\"><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/3090835/view/3112553992726030833\">Microsoft has marked</a> eight games as “Verified,” and six more as “Playable.” The difference between the two can be something as small as a warning appearing or even having to invoke a virtual touchscreen to enter text during a game. While some are only on the playable list right now, they could soon progress to verified status.</p><p id=\"zUSRna\">Microsoft’s list only covers Xbox Game Studios titles currently available on Steam, but you can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/10/22971108/valve-steam-deck-windows-runs-drivers-no-support\">now install Windows on the Steam Deck</a> to access Xbox Game Pass games. Valve has just released Windows drivers, so the option is open for Steam Deck owners to switch over.
