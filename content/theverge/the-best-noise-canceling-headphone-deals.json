However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.</p><p id=\"4B19IV\">That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision, we’ve put together a guide to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\">best noise-canceling headphones</a>, which can help you determine which is right for you.</p><aside id=\"L17MDv\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats\"},{\"title\":\"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"VFH8rh\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10961832\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_nLgkBiQonGQmGOHNTMQMj8pn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21700256/IMG_0640_1.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Sony’s 1000XM4 are the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"GSgzPh\">Sony WH-1000XM4 deals</h2><p id=\"XtIOrp\">Sony’s WH-1000XM4 is our overall pick for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\">best noise-canceling headphones</a>. They offer excellent noise-canceling, good sound and voice quality, and the ability to pair to two devices simultaneously. You can wear these for long periods of time as well, as their plush ear pads make them comfortable to wear for as long as you need. They can even last up to 30 hours on a single charge and can be charged via USB-C.</p><p id=\"VRoMJX\">During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the $349.99 headphones drop to $248 — their lowest price to date.

The headphones pair seamlessly with other Apple devices and sound superb, especially combined with Apple’s surround sound-like spatial audio feature, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to or watching select content. They also tout the best transparency mode of all the headphones on our list and boast incredible build quality thanks to a luxe design that opts for aluminum, steel, and fabric over plastic.</p><p id=\"aqkx5j\">At $549, these headphones are expensive, but many retailers have been heavily discounting them as of late.

We found that they boast detailed, bass-rich sound, a stylish, retro-inspired design, and are extremely comfortable to wear — even when you’re donning glasses. Although their noise cancellation might not rival other models on our list, they make up for it with convenient software features like ambient passthrough and a customizable EQ. Plus, unlike many other headphones, they integrate with the location tracking device, Tile.</p><p id=\"TshVIF\">The headphones typically retail for $399.99, but several retailers have been selling them for $241 since Black Friday.

The headphones also offer intuitive dial controls for both volume and noise cancellation, as well as improved sound quality and battery life over their predecessor. While Microsoft’s noise-canceling tech isn’t quite as effective as Bose’s and Sony’s, the Surface Headphones 2 still adequately silence outside noises so you can focus.</p><p id=\"slxuWB\">During Black Friday, Microsoft’s $249.99 Surface Headphones 2 dropped down to $162.49, which is almost half their typical retail price. We’re not currently seeing any deals that steep, but you can still buy a pair for around $229.99 from <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=VergeDealsRoundup020722&amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-headphones-2%2F8WQ0BSX7G523%2FCS2R%3FOCID%3D%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619711/9383?subId1=TheVergeNCHeadphones142022&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Headphones-2-Black-Wireless%2F226974951&amp;veh=aff\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>.

They boast excellent voice call quality, meaning everybody on your Zoom call will be able to hear you loud and clearly, and they offer great noise cancellation with satisfactory sound. Like the QC45, the over-ears can also connect to two devices simultaneously, but they can’t be folded and only offer 20 hours of battery life, which is also less than other headphones on this list provide. </p><p id=\"FueOFu\">We’ve seen several discounts on the 700s over the past year or so, with the best reaching an all-time low of $299. Lately, however, we haven’t seen any sales that steep.

The budget-friendly headphones come with an “Artificial Intelligence Noise Cancellation” feature, which, according to Sony, will automatically select the proper noise cancellation mode based on the sound levels in your environment. The Bluetooth headphones also feature an ambient mode for when you want to hear what’s going on around you and offer up to 35 hours of continuous playback on a single charge.</p><p id=\"Lhv0bJ\">Sony’s WH-CH710N typically retail for $199.99, but at the moment you can buy them for around $98 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RQYX5Z?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgAhDNLgb8n\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>.</p><div id=\"kxRSKj\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9646609\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4j1HAq7hbPZwDmZwrPPf2lQVu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9478833/akrales_171013_2047_0009.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Beats Studio 3 are nearly half off and thus a good alternative if you’re looking for a more budget-friendly pair of headphones.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"eO1gZ8\">Beats Studio 3 deals</h2><p id=\"4X0vv8\">While <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">we couldn’t recommend</a> these to anybody outside of the Apple ecosystem, the Beats Studio 3 Wireless could be a decent alternative if you want a pair of over-ear headphones from Apple but find the AirPods Max to be too expensive.
