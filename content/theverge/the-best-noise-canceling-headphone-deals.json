However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.</p><p id=\"4B19IV\">That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision, we’ve put together a guide to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\">best noise-canceling headphones</a>, which can help you determine which is right for you.</p><aside id=\"L17MDv\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats\"},{\"title\":\"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"VFH8rh\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10961832\"></div></div><h2 id=\"Peel4Y\">Bose QuietComfort 45 deals</h2>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgeEn8QS5fmt3RpAGVjzP1b7lgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883429/cwelch_202109_4775_5635.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Bose QuietComfort 45s are our pick for the most comfortable noise-canceling headphones.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"NA49IA\">Bose QuietComfort 45s, our pick for the most comfortable noise-canceling headphones, are a pair frequent travelers will surely appreciate. They’re lightweight and foldable, so you can easily carry them around with you, and ear fatigue is unlikely, thanks to their oval ear cups. Battery life now sits at 24 hours as well, meaning you needn’t worry about constantly having to charge them. The new transparency mode, meanwhile, comes in handy when you need to be more aware of your surroundings, like when you’re about to cross the street, while a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937488/bose-qc45-custom-eq-bass-mid-treble-now-available\">recently-introduced firmware update</a> allows you to customize the bass, mid-range, and other aspects of the EQ. The USB-C-equipped headphones don’t offer the same bassy response as Sony’s 1000XM4s, but if comfort is what you’re after, the QC45 offer it in spades.</p><p id=\"tHEs6C\">Right now, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098FKXT8L/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgoISm7Tx1n\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=DChcSEwjJtsDYqar2AhXxE9QBHaUpAooYABAKGgJvYQ&amp;ae=2&amp;sig=AOD64_3jOWhtzy-vRsVe27BU9HnBfe0XtA&amp;ctype=5&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwix6LDYqar2AhXZm2oFHf7qCgUQ9aACegUIARChAQ&amp;adurl=\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adorama</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-45-wireless-bluetooth-noise-cancelling-headphones-black%2F-%2FA-82797330%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtmnv%26DFA%3D71700000089637541%26CPNG%3DPLA_DVM%252Ba064R000011u8xoQAA-Bose_AO_Search_Jan_FY21_FY22%26adgroup%3DPLA_Bose%26LID%3D700000001393753pgs%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9031583%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiA64GRBhCZARIsAHOLriKDSHzAoCUTfrHgvz-VOPmhSVzzkD_yOaWHeOfmsWytzWPxhuSx8tAaAjLZEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestHeadphoneDealsMarch12022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=TheVergeBestHeadphoneDealsMarch32022&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Felectronics%2Faudio%2Fheadphones%2Fbluetooth-headphones%2Fproducts%2Fbose-quietcomfort-45-headphones%2F309718.html%3F\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=DChcSEwjJtsDYqar2AhXxE9QBHaUpAooYABAMGgJvYQ&amp;sig=AOD64_13zf69U_ztAfx2PWm9KTI25zv1IQ&amp;ctype=5&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwix6LDYqar2AhXZm2oFHf7qCgUQww96BAgBED4&amp;adurl=\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bose</a> are selling the QC45 for $279 instead of $329, their best price to date. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"Joupef\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10893423\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKJX7PSEe5X-Kz5k3R15GB486NA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173543/IMG_6828_3.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The AirPods Max is a good pick for those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"Yu5lCJ\">Apple’s AirPods Max deals</h2><p id=\"UfClp3\">If you’re looking for the best sound quality you can get in a pair of noise-canceling headphones, we recommend the AirPods Max. The headphones pair seamlessly with other Apple devices and sound superb, especially combined with Apple’s surround sound-like spatial audio feature, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to or watching select content. They also tout the best transparency mode of all the headphones on our list and boast incredible build quality thanks to a luxe design that opts for aluminum, steel, and fabric over plastic.</p><p id=\"aqkx5j\">At $549, these headphones are expensive, but many retailers have been heavily discounting them as of late.

The headphones also offer intuitive dial controls for both volume and noise cancellation, as well as improved sound quality and battery life over their predecessor. While Microsoft’s noise-canceling tech isn’t quite as effective as Bose’s and Sony’s, the Surface Headphones 2 still adequately silence outside noises so you can focus.</p><p id=\"slxuWB\">During Black Friday, Microsoft’s $249.99 Surface Headphones 2 dropped down to around $162, which is almost half their typical retail price.

They boast excellent voice call quality, meaning everybody on your Zoom call will be able to hear you loud and clearly, and they offer great noise cancellation with satisfactory sound.
