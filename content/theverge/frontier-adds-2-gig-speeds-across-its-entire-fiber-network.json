The plan comes with symmetrical 2-gig downloads and uploads for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffrontier.com%2Foffer%2Ffiber-2-gigabit-internet&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F2%2F22%2F22946356%2Ffrontier-2-gig-speed-fiber-internet-fios\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$149.99 / month</a>, along with the free installation of a Wi-Fi 6E-compatible router and extender.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"bgMWEd\"><q>The first 1,000 who sign up get a free Amazon Fire TV</q></aside></div><p id=\"Gop0Y8\">Frontier is offering a free 43-inch Amazon Fire TV and Logitech webcam for the first 1,000 customers who sign up — but it’s not clear if you’ll be getting the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa\">Omni</a> or 4-Series Fire TV, and it’s just as vague about the Logitech webcam.

Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/24/22898876/att-fiber-multi-gig-connections-speeds\">AT&amp;T announced its rollout of 2-gig and 5-gig plans</a>, priced at $110 / month and $180 / month, respectively. <a href=\"https://www.lightreading.com/cable-tech/comcasts-gigabit-pro-service-accelerates-to-3-gig/d/d-id/773169\">Xfinity also has a 3Gbps plan</a> for a pricey $299.95 / month, and <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/content/verizon/personal/home/2-gigabit-internet.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon has a 2-gig $119 / month plan</a> for New York City residents only. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437958/google-fiber-2-gig-gbps-internet-nashville-huntsville-speed-webpass-pilot\">Google Fiber’s $100 / month 2-gig plan</a> still remains the cheapest of the multi-gig family.</p><p id=\"j52Ukw\">In 2020, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/frontier-prepares-for-bankruptcy-regrets-failure-to-install-enough-fiber/\">Frontier filed for bankruptcy</a> and blamed an “under-investment in fiber deployment” as a reason for its financial struggles. According to <em>Ars Technica</em>, most of Frontier’s fiber connections at the time were actually installed by Verizon, as <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160401005508/en/Frontier-Communications-Completes-Acquisition-of-Verizon-Wireline-Operations-in-California-Texas-and-Florida\">the company purchased Fios operations</a> in California, Texas, and Florida in 2016. The company currently offers service in 25 states and added <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220105005753/en/Frontier-Delivers-Company-Record-for-Fiber-Broadband-Customer-Growth-in-Q4-2021\">45,000 new fiber customers</a> in the last quarter of 2021. </p><p id=\"rR5TH4\">As great as fiber-optic sounds, it’s still just a fantasy for many of us who aren’t cornered in specific areas of the US. And while faster fiber is great and all, it’d be nice to have some more cables laid down so more of us can gain access.</p>",
