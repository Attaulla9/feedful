The Italian dessert has been cropping up in commits since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595631/android-13-tiramisu-2022-internal-dessert-codename\">July last year</a>.</p><p id=\"GS4bL0\">Although each version of Android hasn’t been publicly named after a dessert since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20827231/android-10-q-google-name-officially-announced-new-logo-wordmark-desserts\">2019’s Android 10</a>, the tradition is still alive and well internally at Google. <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2019/08/28/android-10-team-interview/#:~:text=Canada.-,Android%2010%20is%20known,Just,-because\">Android 10 was Quince Tart</a>, Android 11 was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/7/23/21336209/android-11-r-red-velvet-cake-internal-code-name-dessert-google\">Red Velvet Cake</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284545/android-12-dessert-name-snow-cone-start-with-s\">Android 12 was Snow Cone</a>.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"oQ8RpO\"><q>Android 10 was Quince Tart</q></aside></div><p id=\"B0SBCk\">Now that we know that Google has settled on Tiramisu as a codename, we can’t help but turn our attention to Android 14’s tricker U-based options. “Upside-down cake” is the only major dessert I can think of, although Wikipedia informs me that there’s a doughnut-like “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U%C5%A1tipci\">Uštipci</a>” dessert that’s apparently popular in Southeast Europe, and the Philippines’ “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otap_(food)\">Otap</a>” sometimes goes by the name “Utap.” </p><p id=\"knkZsW\">Everyone joked at the time that Android Q’s dessert name would be impossible to come up with, and next year’s Android U might be just as tricky. </p>",
