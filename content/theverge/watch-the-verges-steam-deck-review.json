Today, you no longer need to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review\">read a 4,000-word review</a> or listen to me explain my giant cartoon heart eyes <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950938/vergecast-podcast-steam-deck-samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review\">for 30 minutes on <em>The Vergecast</em></a> to understand my very big feelings: we’ve got a video that shows you the Deck’s biggest wins and its biggest failings. </p><p id=\"GAyPIv\">And it starts with an original Nintendo Game Boy. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"xrdhZD\"><q>OG Game Boy alert</q></aside></div><p id=\"IVabMj\">That’s right: not a Nintendo Switch. My family’s carefully preserved 1989-era Game Boy, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/21/18508022/game-boy-nintendo-games-accessories-anniversary-photo-essay\">previously featured here</a>. You’ll understand why long before you finish.</p><p id=\"iQWzkr\">Plus, you’ll see and hear a few things that didn’t fit into my text review. How does the noisy fan sound? What’s the Wi-Fi speed like? Want proof I played GameCube games on this thing? It’s all here. </p><p id=\"3tLHsZ\">And if you’ve got any more questions by the time you’re done, <em>please</em> send them my way in the comments, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StarFire2258\">@starfire2258</a> on Twitter, or at sean@theverge.com. Not only am I still testing the Deck, I’m also working on a big FAQ.</p><aside id=\"Qu6DDe\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Steam Deck review: it’s not ready\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review\"},{\"title\":\"Vergecast: Steam Deck and Galaxy S22 Ultra\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950938/vergecast-podcast-steam-deck-samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review\"},{\"title\":\"Where’s your Steam Deck preorder email?
