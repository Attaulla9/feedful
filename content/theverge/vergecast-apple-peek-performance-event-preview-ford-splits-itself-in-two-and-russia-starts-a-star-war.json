She also gives Elon and SpaceX the appropriate credit for delivering Starlink to Ukraine after a tweet requesting it.</p><p id=\"W3gAmv\">And there was a Rivian debacle this week, so Andrew Hawkins comes on to tell us about how vehicle pricing went up by as much as $20,000 for some customers who preordered — and then how it was walked back.
