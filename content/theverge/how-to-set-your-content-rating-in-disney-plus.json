When you open the app, you’ll be asked if you want to change your content rating from TV-14, which is somewhat restricted to TV-MA (no restrictions). If you don’t choose, you will be automatically slotted into a TV-14 rating.</p><p id=\"sHClbq\">(Why the new TV-MA rating on what was a very family-friendly service? Perhaps because it’s also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22955274/netflix-marvel-shows-disney-plus-release-date\">bringing in a group of Marvel shows</a>, such as <em>Daredevil</em> and <em>Luke Cage </em>— shows that do <em>not</em> fall into the category of “family-friendly.”)</p><p id=\"1xDOSK\">Here’s how the process works on a computer; you will see a similar series of screens on the mobile or TV app.</p><ul><li id=\"WiVxpO\">When you first open the app, you’ll see what looks like a typical promotional screen. Select continue.</li></ul>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"When you first open the app, you’ll see what looks like a typical promotional screen.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MlcQZbr_gjxgm8LgZ4OoYF7leLI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23320227/Screen_Shot_2022_03_16_at_9.26.02_AM.png\">      <figcaption><em>When you first open the app, you’ll see what looks like a typical promotional screen.</em></figcaption>  </figure><ul><li id=\"1SMclJ\">You’ll then be asked if you want to access the “full catalog” — in other words, if you want to set your rating to TV-MA (nothing left out) rather than TV-14, with more “adult” fare removed. Select <strong>Full Catalog</strong> to keep everything in your selection; you can select <strong>Not Now</strong>, but that will mean your rating will automatically stay at TV-14.</li></ul>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"You’ll be asked if you want to access the “full catalog.” \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDrwyz6gwkLCjt-D4uPEFfk2iQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23320228/Screen_Shot_2022_03_16_at_9.26.21_AM.png\">      <figcaption><em>You’ll be asked if you want to access the “full catalog.” </em></figcaption>  </figure><ul><li id=\"SeofRf\">You’ll be asked to confirm your selection with a password.</li></ul>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Enter your password.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dP-qgT1PkKTALYKsxAxeObqzJzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23320231/Screen_Shot_2022_03_16_at_9.26.50_AM.png\">      <figcaption><em>Enter your password.</em></figcaption>  </figure><ul><li id=\"B0td8o\">Once you’ve done that, you’ll be given the option of creating a Profile PIN.
