The compromised part of the site relates to the World Space Observatory Ultraviolet project (WSO-UV), a project similar to the Hubble Space Telescope and planned for launch in 2025.</p><p id=\"IGpiWX\">A popular Twitter account tied to the loosely organized Anonymous movement shared details Thursday morning and attributed the action to a group known as v0g3lSec.</p><div id=\"6E96pJ\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Russian Space Agency hacked via v0g3lSec<br>[<a href=\"https://t.co/xTq7sCqsNJ\">https://t.co/xTq7sCqsNJ</a>] still hacked as of this posting <br>[archived]<a href=\"https://t.co/CE6NydC65G\">https://t.co/CE6NydC65G</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/tDjVEu6JD2\">pic.twitter.com/tDjVEu6JD2</a></p>— Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/1499380682174480386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 3, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"QKR9M1\">At time of publication, the uv.ikiweb.ru site was inaccessible. An <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220303052232/http://uv.ikiweb.ru/\">archived version</a> of the website captured on the morning of March 3rd shows the message:</p><blockquote><p id=\"gaxWHR\">“Heyyy Russian f*** .. Sorry.. Cosmonauts ??.. idk what to say, go get a nice website instead of threatening people with ISS, heard??”</p></blockquote><p id=\"E9NTIs\">The last part of the message presumably references remarks made by Dmitry Rogozin, head of Roscosmos: after sanctions were announced by the US, Rogozin seemed to imply the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950498/russia-nasa-international-space-station-dmitry-rogozin-roscosmos-ukraine-iss\">partnership between NASA and Russian agencies could come to an end</a>, threatening the future of the International Space Station.</p><p id=\"Y6q2Oq\">The YourAnonNews account also shared a link to a cloud-hosted zip file that claims to be a data leak from the Russian space agency. <em>Vice</em> reports that the download contains a mixture of handwritten forms, PDFs and spreadsheets and includes descriptions of lunar missions. <em>The Verge</em> could not confirm the authenticity of the data.</p><p id=\"yKm5Uf\">The hack against Roscosmos comes just days after another Anonymous-linked group made an unverified claim to have disabled Russian satellite control systems. Twitter posts from the group — operating under the name NB65 — claimed to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xxNB65/status/1498563748226809861\">shut down a monitoring system</a> used by the Russian space agency, although details could not be verified, and the claims were <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/roscosmos-head-dmitry-rogozin-anonymous-russian-satellite-hack-1684033\">rebutted by Rogozin</a>.</p><p id=\"xsGZMm\">As the ground war between Russia and Ukraine continues, the cyber domain has seen a growing number of vigilante actors mounting operations against Russia and its allies, with data leaks emerging as a strategic tool. Besides NB65, a hacking group known as AgainstTheWest claimed to have <a href=\"https://cybernews.com/news/hackers-breach-rosatom-russias-state-nuclear-energy-corporation/\">breached the Rosatom nuclear energy company</a>; elsewhere, a group operating under the name Anonymous Liberland <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LatestAnonPress/status/1497515581268021251\">released 200GB of emails</a> taken from Belarusian defense contractor Tetraedr.</p><p id=\"eq8FWI\">In recent decades, Russia and the US have cooperated on a number of space missions, but there are signs that Russian space agencies are being drawn into the conflict. The commercial satellites of London-based company OneWeb were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/2/22958082/russia-roscosmos-oneweb-soyuz-launch-demands-ukraine-invasion\">effectively held hostage</a> by Roscosmos when the Russian agency halted a launch planned to take place this week and issued a list of demands to its customer. Roscosmos also stated that Russia would <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22959691/russia-roscosmos-rocket-engines-ula-northrop-grumman-rd-180-181\">no longer sell rocket engines to the United States</a>, although the move would have a limited impact on US companies.</p>",
