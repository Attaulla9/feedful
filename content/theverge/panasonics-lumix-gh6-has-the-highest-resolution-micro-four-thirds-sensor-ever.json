The new numbered entry in the popular GH line was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451677/panasonic-gh6-gh5-mark-ii-2-live-streaming-video-camera\">teased</a> almost a year ago alongside the launch of the GH5 Mark II; Panasonic confirmed at the time that it would shoot up to 10-bit 4:2:0 4K at 120fps, 10-bit 4:2:2 4K at 60fps, and 10-bit 5.7K at 60fps.</p><p id=\"aEphb7\">Now the camera has been revealed in full, and while it looks similar to its predecessor and features the same 3-inch articulating screen, the internals are all new. There’s a new 25.2-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor and a new Venus Engine image processor, which together let you shoot photos at 14 frames per second with autofocus locked. It’s the highest resolution sensor ever found in a Four Thirds or Micro Four Thirds camera.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I2Mqy3berqS7cW-WkXywCVb8HU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23262290/gh6_top_slider03.jpg\">  </figure><p id=\"dwj4yB\">Panasonic has also added a built-in fan to the camera to allow it to record for longer periods, and the new five-axis image stabilization system adds a claimed 7.5 stops of compensation. The GH6 is the first Lumix Micro Four Thirds camera to include the V-Log format and V-Gamut color space, which preserves more dynamic range for post-production.</p><p id=\"OszcUf\">The Lumix GH6 will cost $2,199 body-only next month, which is $500 more than the GH5 Mark II and $200 more than the original GH5, but actually cheaper than the $2,499 price it was expected to launch at last year. Between this and the OM System OM-1, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/15/22934471/om-system-om-1-announced-olympus-specs-price\">which was announced last week</a> and is the first new model to come from Olympus’ sold-off camera business, it’s a good time to be a high-end user in the Micro Four Thirds system.</p>",
