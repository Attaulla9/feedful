But about an hour after I first noticed problems, Twitter said things were fixed. </p><p id=\"lVRcBn\">“We’ve fixed a technical bug that was preventing timelines from loading and Tweets from posting,” the company said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1492200491769597960\">via its support account</a>. “Things should be back to normal now.

The presence and scope of any customer impact has not been determined at this time, but we will provide an update as soon as we know more.” However, given Twitter’s support account update, it seems likely this issue has been resolved.</p><p id=\"nh8ysD\">Looking at <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/map/\">Downdetector’s outage map</a>, it appears the issues primarily affected West Coast users. That includes me — I’m based in Portland, OR. (Perhaps that red dot over Portland in the first screenshot below is the Downdetector report I made.) </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wqO5osqRhuOIn0jnapoz5mv-q98=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23235630/Screen_Shot_2022_02_11_at_9.47.26_AM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters</cite>      <figcaption><em>Downdetector’s outage map as of 12:47PM ET.</em></figcaption>  </figure>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CsxJtZ7VZyME9T3dHIliQteNM6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23235711/Screen_Shot_2022_02_11_at_10.22.18_AM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters</cite>      <figcaption><em>And here’s the map at 1:22PM ET.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"vE8v1v\">Three California-based <em>Verge </em>staffers also said they were seeing problems, though many East Coast-based staffers seemed to have no issues. TweetDeck has also continued to work for me without problems.</p><p id=\"RZbIsw\"><em><strong>Update February 11th, 1:30PM ET</strong></em><em>: Twitter says the problems are fixed.</em></p>",
