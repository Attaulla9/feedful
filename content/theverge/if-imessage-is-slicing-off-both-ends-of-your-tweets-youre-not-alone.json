If you’re on an Apple device and texting a tweet to your buddy on an Apple device, the first and last characters in the tweet might not show up. As <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/18/latest-random-twitter-bug-causes-text-to-disappear-in-imessage-previews/\">reported by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>, tweet previews sent via iMessage seem to be missing the first and last characters of the tweet, making them read oddly.</p><p id=\"Edl8jp\">Myself and another <em>Verge</em> writer have experienced this bug as well. Here’s how Apple’s Messages app on my iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch displayed a tweet I wrote yesterday:</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJ1cgemBt5VTWyhIY9DAjOLEZbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23256381/Screen_Shot_2022_02_18_at_3.03.16_PM.png\">      <cite>Screenshots by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Can you guess what letters are missing?</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"Au7W4y\">And here’s what the tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1494367321653010448\">I made yesterday</a> actually looked like:</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cKUdSR-TZOdheyFBIpg3GiXirfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23256366/Screen_Shot_2022_02_18_at_2.54.59_PM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>(They didn’t.)</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"QxC10a\">When reached for comment, Twitter spokesperson Stephanie Cortez originally said the bug seems to have been fixed, but it turns out that’s not the case — Cortez said shortly after we published this article that the company is aware of the issue and looking into a fix. Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p id=\"WqCrXU\">Hopefully this is resolved quickly — otherwise, your group chat might be filled with some tweets that seem even stranger than usual.</p><p id=\"wqyj1t\"><em><strong>Update February 18th, 6:48PM ET</strong></em><em>: Added confirmation from Twitter that there’s an issue.</em></p>",
