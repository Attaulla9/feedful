As seen via <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/asus-rog-strix-touchstone-gpu-keycap-spinning-fans\"><em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>, a new custom keycap in the form of an Asus ROG Strix brand GPU is now <a href=\"https://www.zfrontier.com/app/mch/B5GWG6RgENal\">on sale in China</a>. It replaces the right-shift key on your keyboard and comes with three miniature spinning cooling fans (though, sadly, there are no tiny customizable LED lights). </p><p id=\"69Nv7l\">It’s not the first novelty GPU keycap we’ve seen. Last year, a custom keycap resembling an NVIDIA RTX 3080 <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/nvidia/rtx-3080-keycap\">started doing the rounds</a>, and became something of a talisman for gamers struggling to buy the real thing due to the ongoing chip shortage. (And which is now available to buy from places like AliExpress <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F4001195978157.html%3F_randl_currency%3DUSD%26_randl_shipto%3DUS%26src%3Dgoogle%26memo1%3Dfreelisting%26aff_fcid%3D11cb14c7378f425f9f691b6dcf6a506e-1644317545291-05022-UneMJZVf%26aff_fsk%3DUneMJZVf%26aff_platform%3Daaf%26sk%3DUneMJZVf%26aff_trace_key%3D11cb14c7378f425f9f691b6dcf6a506e-1644317545291-05022-UneMJZVf%26terminal_id%3D6c1f976648fb43e9a543a59123eca799&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F2%2F8%2F22923216%2Fgpu-custom-keycap-asus-rog-strix\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for around $40.</a>)</p><div id=\"ObP6bn\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11017985\"></div></div><p id=\"hstVec\">These keycaps are just novelties, of course, and there’s no indication that the Asus ROG Strix model has been endorsed by Asus. Nevertheless, whoever’s making this thing has a great eye for detail. As the unboxing video below shows, they’ve gone to a lot of trouble to replicate all the packaging for an actual Strix product and the end-result is pretty charming.</p><aside id=\"3TAXOc\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Designers spend months making custom keycaps, then the counterfeits arrive\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22905351/mechanical-keyboard-keycap-clones-imitators-knockoffs-olivia-biip\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"pthzi0\">According to details provided on zFrontier, the keycap has an all metal design, weighs 34 grams, and has dimensions of 51mm x 18mm x 11mm. It also has Cherry MX-style mounts. It won’t actually speed up your PC build, of course, but it could be a fun distraction to tap and spin and tap while you’re waiting for loading screens to clear. </p><div id=\"WjOKDA\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVapKB0D9eg?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"pCuWYV\"></p>",
