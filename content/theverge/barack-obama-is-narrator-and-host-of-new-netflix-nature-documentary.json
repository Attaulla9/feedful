Surfing hippos that want to catch the waves. Species found nowhere else on earth,” Obama says in the trailer for <em>Our Great National Parks</em>. “When humanity started to protect these wild places, we did not realize how important they would become: They’re a haven for endangered species, and a hotbed for scientific research.”</p><p id=\"WRZsS4\"><em>Deadline</em> <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/03/barack-obama-our-great-national-parks-hosting-docuseries-netflix-higher-ground-1234978675/\">reports</a> that the show includes footage from parks in Monterey Bay, California, Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and Gunung Leuser National Park in the rainforests of Indonesia. </p><p id=\"6N3j1x\">The Obamas signed a multi-year agreement with Netflix <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/21/17376654/barack-obama-michelle-obama-netflix-shows\">in 2018</a>, with a stated goal of creating “a diverse mix of content, including the potential for scripted series, unscripted series, docuseries, documentaries, and features” from Higher Ground Productions. In addition to the national parks series, the company has brought to Netflix the children’s shows <em>Ada Twist, Scientist</em>, and <em>Waffles + Mochi</em>; the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/obama-win-oscar-best-documentary-american-factory-1203498032/\">Oscar-winning documentary <em>American Factory</em></a>; the Peabody Award-winning film <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/movies/crip-camp-review.html\"><em>Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution</em></a>, and<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81122487\"><em>Becoming</em></a><em>, </em>based on Michelle Obama’s memoir. </p><p id=\"tOrFJh\"><em>Our Great National Parks</em> debuts on Netflix April 13th.</p>",
