Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14173514/amazon-books-physical-store-new-york-city-columbus-circle-2017\">since expanded</a> to 24 bookstores across the US, all of which are now slated to be closed down. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"iOciLs\"><q>Amazon is ending most of its retail experiments to focus on grocery stores</q></aside></div><p id=\"dTZcdW\">The company would go on to expand its retail efforts with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17907520/amazon-4-star-retail-store-new-york-soho\">Amazon 4-Star in 2018</a>, with a more generally focused store that sold products with a four-star or higher rating curated from Amazon’s digital storefront, along with — of course — Amazon’s own first-party products (including Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devices). </p><p id=\"RVUxmd\">Amazon Pop Up stores, on the other hand, were smaller, more focused mall experiences that offered rotating themed products (March is a printer collaboration with Brother, for example). </p><p id=\"cf4R38\">All of Amazon’s retail locations, however, helped serve as a physical contact point to return Amazon products, in addition to offering lower prices and perks to Amazon Prime subscribers. </p><p id=\"TthYr1\">The news isn’t entirely shocking: Amazon’s retail ambitions have largely felt like small-scale trials compared to the massive scale of its online operations. And, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/19/amazons-sprawling-grocery-business-has-become-an-expensive-hobby.html\">as <em>CNBC</em> reports</a>, the company’s physical locations have performed far worse than its digital storefront in recent years. </p><p id=\"OLn9wo\">Amazon isn’t exiting brick-and-mortar stores entirely. The company will continue to operate its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22324948/amazon-fresh-grocery-stores-chain-usa-dash-carts\">Amazon Fresh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/16/15816174/amazon-whole-foods-acquisition-supermarket-stores\">Whole Foods grocery stores</a>, as well as its Amazon Go convenience stores (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869294/amazon-go-store-chicago-cashier-less\">with their unique cashier-less model</a>). <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892880/amazon-style-fashion-apperal-retail-los-angeles-fitting-room\">Amazon’s experimental “Amazon Style”</a> clothing store is also sticking around, too. </p><p id=\"jNa8nl\">Amazon has yet to say when exactly it’ll be closing up its physical shops, although <em>Reuters</em> reports that timing will vary from store to store. </p>",
