The automaker will instead ship the missing semiconductors to dealers within one year, which they will then install in customers’ vehicles after purchase.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"KFSKie\"><q>Customers who purchase a vehicle without the rear controls will receive a price reduction</q></aside></div><p id=\"buWTn6\">Ford spokesperson Said Deep told <em>The Verge</em> that heating and air condition will still be controllable from the front seats, and that customers who choose to purchase a vehicle without the rear controls will receive a price reduction. According to Deep, Ford is doing this as a way to bring new Explorers to customers faster, and that the change is only temporary.</p><p id=\"xVMfZh\"><a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2021/07/19/ford-chip-shortage-vehicles/8013003002/\">The automaker originally had plans</a> to ship partially-built, undrivable vehicles to dealers last year, but now, the unchipped vehicles will be both driveable <em>and</em> sellable. As pointed out by <em>Automotive News</em>, Ford’s decision comes as an attempt to move the partially-built vehicles crowding its factory lots. Last month, hundreds of new <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/sales/ford-broncos-pile-new-delays-test-buyers-patience\">Ford Broncos were spotted sitting idly</a> in the snow-covered lots near Ford’s Michigan Assembly Plant, all of which await chip-related installations.</p><p id=\"LjZaP8\">Like many other companies, Ford has been grappling with the constraints introduced by the chip shortage. After the lack of semiconductors <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage\">forced Ford to scale back production of its popular F-150</a> last year (and once again <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/04/chip-shortage-forces-ford-to-cut-production-of-f-150-bronco-suv.html\">earlier this month</a>), it started giving customers the option to purchase the <a href=\"https://fordauthority.com/2021/08/2021-ford-f-150-can-be-built-without-start-stop-under-new-plan/\">pickup without automatic start-stop</a>, the feature that turns a vehicle’s engine off when it comes to a complete stop. Ford gave affected owners a $50 credit in return.</p><p id=\"F6fuWi\">Other automakers have also had to make sacrifices due to the chip shortage, with GM dropping <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage\">wireless charging</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/tech/41307/gm-pulls-hd-radio-from-2021-silverado-and-sierra-pickups-over-chip-shortage\">HD radios</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions\">a fuel management module</a> that made some pickup trucks operate more efficiently. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports\">Tesla sold some cars without USB ports</a> and made them installable at a later date. Luxury cars haven’t been exempt from the shortage either, as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage\">Cadillac nixed its hands-free driving feature</a> in its 2022 Escalade, while <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing\">BMW began shipping some cars without touchscreens</a>.</p><aside id=\"H8sZ8x\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here’s how bad the chip shortage is, according to the White House\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/25/22900987/chip-shortage-report-biden-commerce-secretary-raimondo\"},{\"title\":\"Ford’s ‘radical’ move to split the company won’t come easy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/2/22958243/ford-split-compoany-risks-model-e-blue-ev\"},{\"title\":\"Ford and GM are getting into chip development to help deal with the shortage \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789413/ford-gm-chip-shortage-globalfoundries-qualcomm-tsmc\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"53tD2R\"><em><strong>Update March 13th 1:45PM ET: </strong></em><em>Updated to clarify that the affected vehicles are Ford Explorers and that they’ll be missing rear HVAC controls.
