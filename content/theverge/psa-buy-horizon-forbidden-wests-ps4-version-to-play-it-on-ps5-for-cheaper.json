While you might see listings for $69.99, <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/\">such as on this landing page</a>, you should know that the standard edition of the PS4 version of <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> is $10 cheaper and has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657679/sony-horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-ps5-upgrade-free\">a free upgrade to the PS5 version</a>.</p><p id=\"dQaeiC\">In September, Sony announced that the game <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654091/horizon-forbidden-west-no-next-gen-upgrade-ps4-ps5\">wouldn’t have an upgrade path from PS4 to PS5</a>, despite <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657200/sony-upgrade-playstation-horizon-forbidden-west-ps5\">originally promising a free upgrade</a>, and Sony <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657679/sony-horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-ps5-upgrade-free\">quickly pivoted</a> in response to fan outcry. PlayStation boss Jim Ryan stated it plainly <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/04/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/\">on the PlayStation Blog</a>: “Players who purchase Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 4 will be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free.”</p><p id=\"IYUEsT\">Earlier this week, it wasn’t immediately obvious that an upgrade is available. On that <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/\">landing page</a> I mentioned earlier, the PS4 listing did not note that buyers would also get a free PS5 upgrade. Now, though, there’s a bullet spelling out the free digital upgrade.</p><p id=\"OroZ67\">Here are two screenshots showing the differences:</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3OfFyLs8k067u-LovcjdcdnZhY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23224548/Screen_Shot_2022_02_07_at_1.09.30_PM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/\" target=\"_blank\">Sony’s <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> website</a></cite>      <figcaption><em>Here were the listings on Monday...</em></figcaption>  </figure>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XqXpCh0stnQfB2HfD2fja-HM9Wc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23233667/Screen_Shot_2022_02_10_at_2.31.29_PM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/\" target=\"_blank\">Sony’s <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> website</a></cite>      <figcaption><em>...and this is what they say now. Note the new bullet under the PS4 standard edition.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"K90WC3\">The <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA28561_00-FORBIDDENWESTPS4\">PS4-specific store listing</a> for the <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> standard edition has been similarly updated to include a bullet about the PS5 upgrade. However, <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/horizon-forbidden-west-support/\">Sony’s own support page about <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> is still outdated; it currently says that you have to buy the more expensive versions of <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> to access both the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game. </p><p id=\"jqy7q5\">So if you’re looking to save a few bucks on your upcoming <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> purchase, consider picking up the standard edition of the PS4 version instead. But grab it on Sony’s website or the PlayStation app — on my PS5, I couldn’t find the PS4 listing.</p><p id=\"pzUqjc\"><em><strong>Update February 10th, 5:46PM ET</strong></em><em>: Sony’s </em>Horizon Forbidden West<em> listings now mention the free PS5 upgrade.</em></p>",
