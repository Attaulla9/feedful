While you might see listings for $69.99, <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/\">such as on this landing page</a>, you should know that the standard edition of the PS4 version of <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> is $10 cheaper and has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657679/sony-horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-ps5-upgrade-free\">a free upgrade to the PS5 version</a>.</p><p id=\"dQaeiC\">In September, Sony announced that the game <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654091/horizon-forbidden-west-no-next-gen-upgrade-ps4-ps5\">wouldn’t have an upgrade path from PS4 to PS5</a>, despite <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657200/sony-upgrade-playstation-horizon-forbidden-west-ps5\">originally promising a free upgrade</a>, and Sony <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657679/sony-horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-ps5-upgrade-free\">quickly pivoted</a> in response to fan outcry. PlayStation boss Jim Ryan stated it plainly <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/04/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/\">on the PlayStation Blog</a>: “Players who purchase Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 4 will be able to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version for free.”</p><p id=\"K90WC3\">Despite that promise, it’s not immediately obvious that an upgrade is available when looking at listings for <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> on Sony’s website. That <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/\">landing page</a> I mentioned earlier leads with the $69.99 version, and you have to scroll down a little ways to find the cheaper PS4 version. That PS4 listing has a bullet that indicates it only works on PS4, even though a box <em>right above the bullet</em> suggests it also works on PS5. (To be fair, that PS5 box could just indicate that the PS4 version of the game will run on PS5.)</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3OfFyLs8k067u-LovcjdcdnZhY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23224548/Screen_Shot_2022_02_07_at_1.09.30_PM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/\" target=\"_blank\">Sony’s <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> website</a></cite>      <figcaption><em>Can you spot the difference?</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"macLNY\">In addition, the <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA28561_00-FORBIDDENWESTPS4\">PS4-specific store listing</a> for the <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> standard edition does not specify that you’ll get a free upgrade to the PS5. And <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/horizon-forbidden-west-support/\">Sony’s own support page about <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> is outdated; it currently says that you have to buy the more expensive versions of <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> to access both the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game, which isn’t the case based on Ryan’s promise. Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p id=\"tzOLk1\">So if you’re looking to save a few bucks on your upcoming <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> purchase, consider picking up the standard edition of the PS4 version instead. But grab it on Sony’s website or the PlayStation app — on my PS5, I couldn’t find the PS4 listing.</p>",
