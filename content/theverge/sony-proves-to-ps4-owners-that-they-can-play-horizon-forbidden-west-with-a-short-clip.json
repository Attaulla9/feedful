To prove it, developer Guerrilla Games has shown off a — extremely brief — preview of the game running on a vanilla PlayStation 4 for the first time. </p><p id=\"FgHJVM\">Since <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> was first announced in June 2020, Guerrilla Games has almost exclusively shown footage of the <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> sequel on the PS5. A <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2022/01/27/a-glimpse-at-horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-gameplay/\">short blog post at the end of January</a> showed off PS4 Pro clips, but base PS4 gameplay has been scarce until now (a scant nine days before release). </p><aside id=\"fUzXTt\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Horizon Forbidden West’s new story trailer brings back Aloy’s old friends\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891232/horizon-forbidden-west-story-trailer-ps5\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"LL3fq8\">The 22-second clip doesn’t give the <em>best</em> idea of how <em>Forbidden West</em> will actually run on Sony’s least-powerful console to get the game — nor is it a particularly graphically intensive sequence. But it’s nice to know that a console released in 2013 can run a AAA flagship title for its next-gen successor while still looking pretty great.</p><p id=\"mDLnvv\">And with <em>Horizon</em> <em>Forbidden West</em> set to release soon, it’ll likely be just a matter of time until players can get a better look at how the game actually runs on older hardware. Either way, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/7/22922306/sony-ps5-horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-standard-edition-free-upgrade\">players are better off buying the PS4 edition</a> of the game (which costs $10 less but still has a free PS5 upgrade after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/4/22657200/sony-upgrade-playstation-horizon-forbidden-west-ps5\">backlash from players</a>). </p>",
