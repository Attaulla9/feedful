The DFEH alleges that the federal settlement would harm its own case by potentially letting Activision Blizzard destroy relevant evidence. In December, however, a judge <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834691/judge-denies-california-dfeh-block-activision-blizzard-eeoc-lawsuit-settlement\">denied its request</a> to formally join the suit to oppose the agreement.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"oSO8qW\"><q>“There is no reason to think that a stay would simplify anything about this lawsuit”</q></aside></div><p id=\"BNx8pU\">The DFEH <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872861/california-dfeh-appeals-decision-activision-blizzard-settlement-eeoc\">appealed last month</a>, but while the appeal will proceed, the EEOC’s case won’t be stayed during that period. “DFEH has never clearly enunciated what advantage it seeks to gain by its participation as a formal party,” wrote Judge Dale Fischer, noting that the agency can make its case against the proposed consent decree between the EEOC and Activision Blizzard as an outside party. “Similarly, there is no reason to think that a stay would simplify anything about this lawsuit.” A hearing will be set to weigh formally approving the federal settlement.</p><p id=\"OmSL0S\">The complaints against Activision Blizzard predate Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889421/microsoft-acquires-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-warcraft-king-gaming-buy-news-reports\">announcing plans to acquire it</a>; according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22941636/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-sec-filing-came-together\">a recent SEC filing</a>, the companies entered discussions a couple of months after the EEOC agreement was proposed. The proposed settlement requires Activision Blizzard to set up an $18 million fund for employees who suffered harm alongside other measures, a change that would come alongside the departure of some <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack\">high-level figures</a> at the company — but not, so far, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/22889580/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-bobby-kotick\">CEO Bobby Kotick</a>.</p>",
