But the company had a surprise announcement too — <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902490/Aperture_Desk_Job/\"><em>Aperture Desk Job</em></a>, a new bite-size experience set in the <em>Portal</em> universe that’ll be a free download March 1st. It’s designed to introduce new Steam Deck buyers to the handheld’s incredible array of controls, and it involves... toilets and chairs.</p><p id=\"sYYDM4\">Assuming you’re not already halfway through the video teaser atop this post, here’s how Valve tries to thread the needle between <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20971514/valve-announces-half-life-alyx-its-first-flagship-vr-game\">our rampant desire for Valve to remember how to count to three</a> and the potential disappointment that Valve has not yet managed it:</p><blockquote><p id=\"9QCyC0\"><em>Aperture Desk Job</em> reimagines the been-there-done-that genre of walking simulators and puts them in the lightning-spanked, endorphin-gorged world of sitting still behind things.</p><p id=\"lIealP\">You play as an entry-level nobody on their first day at work — your heart full of hope and your legs full of dreams, eager to climb that corporate ladder. But life’s got other plans, and they all involve chairs.</p><p id=\"GsYysx\">Designed as a free playable short for Valve’s new Steam Deck, <em>Desk Job</em> walks you through the handheld’s controls and features, while not being nearly as boring as that sounds.</p><p id=\"OPJU12\"><strong>Not </strong><em><strong>Portal 3</strong></em><strong>!</strong></p><p id=\"S2bHCB\">Lower your expectations: This is not a sequel to <em>Portal</em>. Now get ready to raise them slightly, because it is in the expanded universe of those games.</p></blockquote><p id=\"AYuxVb\">It looks fun! But it surprised me for two reasons:</p><ol><li id=\"LZ0ZKn\">Valve never said a word to me about it.</li><li id=\"JzFUG6\">Valve <em>explicitly </em>said to journalists it wasn’t<em> </em>going to do anything like this.</li></ol><p id=\"vXq5fy\">In an exclusive interview, <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/\"><em>Edge Magazine</em></a><em> </em>asked Valve founder Gabe Newell if his company ever considered developing a “bespoke” game to “demonstrate hardware capabilities” that would launch alongside the Deck, like Valve did <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/htc-vive-valve-the-lab-steamvr-desktop-theater-mode-gdc-2016/\">with <em>The Lab</em></a> or other experiences in VR.</p><p id=\"C34VOD\">Gaben reportedly said:  </p><blockquote><p id=\"5Q6cia\">Yeah. I mean, we looked at it — it’s just a question of resources and time. We decided to spend more of our resources on our existing games like<em> Dota</em> and <em>Counter-Strike</em> and thinking of ways to make them better on this device. We just felt like that was more bang for our buck than building a sort of gamelet.</p></blockquote><p id=\"5gJFu5\">Valve also suggested me <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview\">in August</a> that they wouldn’t make any games exclusive to portables the way they made <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> exclusive to VR, and <a href=\"https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/faq\">wrote in an FAQ</a> that the idea of Steam Deck exclusives “doesn’t make much sense to us.” </p><p id=\"IdBMas\">But perhaps it’s not exclusive. And either way, I’m definitely not going to look a gift <em>Portal </em>experience in the mouth.</p><aside id=\"wZUdjh\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"J.J.
