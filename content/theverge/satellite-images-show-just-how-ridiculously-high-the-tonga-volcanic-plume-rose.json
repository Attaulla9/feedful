Rising 58 kilometers (36 miles) above Earth, the volcanic plume was likely the tallest ever measured by satellite, according to NASA.</p><p id=\"gSjRHw\">NASA was able to measure the plume because two weather satellites happened to be in the right place at the right time. Those satellites took still images and infrared observations that give a play-by-play of the eruption from above.</p><p id=\"6oIHrN\">In just 30 minutes or so following the eruption, ash, steam, and gas from the underwater volcano rose from the surface of the ocean all the way up to the mesosphere. A second blast rose nearly as high, reaching 50 kilometers (31 miles) — placing it <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/layers#:~:text=The%20Stratosphere%20extends%20around%2031,the%20temperature%20increases%20with%20height.\">right around the border</a> between the mesosphere and the stratosphere, the next layer down. </p><div id=\"QTTrEQ\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Incredible new analysis: parallax observations by GOES &amp; Himawari show that the Hunga Tonga eruption sent its plume of ash and gas to the mesosphere.<br><br>This is likely a new record in the satellite era.<a href=\"https://t.co/wvqfYIHfIS\">https://t.co/wvqfYIHfIS</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/remotesensing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#remotesensing</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/earthobservation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#earthobservation</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/scicomm?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#scicomm</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/maps?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#maps</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/cgD58EUvvx\">pic.twitter.com/cgD58EUvvx</a></p>— Joshua Stevens (@jscarto) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jscarto/status/1494069581312368653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"Ty5lHW\">An explosive combination of extreme heat from the volcano and moisture from the ocean helped propel the volcanic plume to such a startling height.</p><p id=\"lMND3Y\">“It was like hyper-fuel for a mega-thunderstorm,” <a href=\"https://science.larc.nasa.gov/people/kristopher-bedka/\">Kristopher Bedka</a>, an atmospheric scientist at NASA, said in a statement. “The plume went 2.5 times higher than any thunderstorm we have ever observed, and the eruption generated an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/reuters-graphic-tongas-apocalyptic-lightning-storm-2022-02-14/\">incredible amount of lightning</a>.”</p><p id=\"lnAJa4\">When volcanoes spew emissions into the atmosphere, they can actually temporarily cool things down both locally and globally. That’s largely due to the sunlight-reflecting particles of sulfur dioxide found in volcanic ash. But because there was so much water vapor and not a lot of sulfur dioxide in this plume, it probably won’t have that effect, according to NASA.</p><p id=\"0iTSFK\">The plume from that historic eruption rose and disbursed over 13 hours on January 15th. But some of its leftover aerosols have persisted and could linger in the stratosphere (just below the mesosphere) for a full year. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Image: NASA / GOES-17 imagery courtesy of NOAA and the&amp;nbsp;National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service&amp;nbsp;(NESDIS)\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjWPEVJqQfddnCqdLB0ytr3DWnM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23252737/hungatonga_goes_2022015_lrg.jpeg\">      <cite>Image:</cite>      <figcaption>NASA scientists analyzed images from NOAA’s <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.goes-r.gov/multimedia/dataAndImageryImagesGoes-17.html\" target=\"_blank\">Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 17</a> (GOES-17), which show the plume at various stages on January 15.</figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"mNqNeC\">The eruption also triggered a devastating tsunami that swept over Tonga.
