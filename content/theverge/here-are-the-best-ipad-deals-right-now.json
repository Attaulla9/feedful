Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. </p><p id=\"H2aVlZ\">Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find the most notable deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at <em>The Verge </em>are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals available on each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. </p><aside id=\"ehglg9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals\"},{\"title\":\"The best deals on MacBooks right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"jzeS15\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10754964\"></div></div><h2 id=\"hb2n3u\">The best iPad (2021) deals</h2><p id=\"q5ZrvP\">Announced during the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey\">September iPhone 13 event</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade\">2021 iPad</a> is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom\">eighth-gen model from 2020</a>. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model, if you can even find it. As a result, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.</p><p id=\"fMZ13y\">The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has 64GB of storage instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with 256GB of storage for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant $609. </p><p id=\"WMpIom\">The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams\">Center Stage</a>, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.</p><div id=\"qnjdLM\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10752834\"></div></div><p id=\"5m6ZrK\">While we’ve seen it plunge to as low as $299, at the moment, there are currently no deals available on the base model. However, those living close to a Micro Center store <a href=\"https://www.microcenter.com/product/642262/apple-ipad-102-inch-9th-generation-(late-2021)-space-gray\">can buy the gray, 64GB LTE model for $399.99 instead of $459</a>.

It has forfeited its 3.5-millimeter headphone jack and dedicated home button in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.</p><p id=\"sBkkEE\">The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is, especially now that Apple and other retailers have officially discontinued selling the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet\">2019 model</a>. </p><div id=\"NMDW5P\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10743705\"></div></div><p id=\"zw4xQv\">Right now, discounts on the sixth-gen Mini are fairly limited.

The fourth-gen iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. </p><div id=\"dnrxd6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10917835\"></div></div><p id=\"qbbFob\">If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available at Best Buy on clearance in the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgmi02BD2dZ\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">256GB, Wi-Fi configuration for $764.99</a>.

The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest MacBook Air — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.</p><aside id=\"kIHPXF\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"I5hP3e\">If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi starts at $799.
