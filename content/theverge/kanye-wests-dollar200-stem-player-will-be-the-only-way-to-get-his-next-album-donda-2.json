Not on Apple Amazon Spotify or YouTube.” </p><p id=\"TymYdZ\">While Ye’s reasoning is separate from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22922714/neil-young-spotify-letter-ceo-daniel-ek-employees-joe-rogan\">other artists</a> who’ve recently spoken out about Spotify’s Joe Rogan situation and the stark difference between his <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/17/22939587/joe-rogan-experience-spotify-podcast-deal\">$200 million deal</a> vs. how much it pays them, the conclusion is the same. As he wrote <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CaGuRhADEib/\">in another post</a>, “Today artists get just 12% of the money the industry makes. It’s time to free music from this oppressive system. It’s time to take control and build our own. Go to stemplayer.com now to order.”</p><p id=\"NmY03r\">The album <a href=\"https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/d161d293-f52e-426b-8df3-65295ddd6e19\">is scheduled</a> to launch on Tuesday,

Stem Player</a> launched last year in a partnership with Kano Computing, shipping with the first Donda album so that you could manipulate any song using the touch-sensitive light sliders embedded in its beige shell. “We currently have 67,000 available and are making 3,000 a day,” said Ye in another post.</p><p id=\"2Qy8aj\">It worked well in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22841567/kanye-west-ye-stem-player-kano-computing-music-gadget\">our testing</a>, allowing owners to easily manipulate different parts of a song while listening, whether for one of the included tracks or any others loaded via its web-based interface. However, adding loops and effects can get more complicated. It has 8GB of storage, connections via USB-C, Bluetooth, or 3.5mm headphone jack, and a 97db speaker.</p><p id=\"AtyNpK\">The details of the upcoming album’s exclusivity are murky — will it cost anything for Stem Player owners to download? — but this isn’t Ye’s first exploration into limited release music. In February 2016, he released The Life of Pablo exclusively via Tidal, tweeting that it “will never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale.” On April 1st of that year, The Life of Pablo launched for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play — Ye eventually <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205754/kanye-west-tidal-lawsuit-life-of-pablo-apple-music\">settled a lawsuit from a fan</a> who said they signed up for Tidal based on its exclusivity. </p><p id=\"9k7gz1\">In 2017, TMZ reported Kanye West was canceling his contract with Tidal, and the outlet <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/3/15913548/kanye-west-leaving-tidal-contract-termination-money\">said it was in dispute over millions</a> of dollars he believed the company owed him. It also cited sources saying he would be “done with exclusives.”</p><aside id=\"IMOKCn\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Kanye West says his new album will be a permanent Tidal exclusive \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/15/11008932/kanye-life-of-pablo-tidal-exclusive-permanently\"},{\"title\":\"Kanye West’s The Life of Pablo is now on Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/1/11343526/kanye-west-life-of-pablo-spotify-itunes\"}]}'></div></aside><div class=\"c-float-left\"><div id=\"LK95Os\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CaHPUviLdEd/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" ><div > <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CaHPUviLdEd/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"  target=\"_blank\"> <div > <div ></div> <div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div></div><div ></div> <div ><svg width=\"50px\" height=\"50px\" viewbox=\"0 0 60 60\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"https://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><g stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><g transform=\"translate(-511.000000, -20.000000)\" fill=\"#000000\"><g><path d=\"M556.869,30.41 C554.814,30.41 553.148,32.076 553.148,34.131 C553.148,36.186 554.814,37.852 556.869,37.852 C558.924,37.852 560.59,36.186 560.59,34.131 C560.59,32.076 558.924,30.41 556.869,30.41 M541,60.657 C535.114,60.657 530.342,55.887 530.342,50 C530.342,44.114 535.114,39.342 541,39.342 C546.887,39.342 551.658,44.114 551.658,50 C551.658,55.887 546.887,60.657 541,60.657 M541,33.886 C532.1,33.886 524.886,41.1 524.886,50 C524.886,58.899 532.1,66.113 541,66.113 C549.9,66.113 557.115,58.899 557.115,50 C557.115,41.1 549.9,33.886 541,33.886 M565.378,62.101 C565.244,65.022 564.756,66.606 564.346,67.663 C563.803,69.06 563.154,70.057 562.106,71.106 C561.058,72.155 560.06,72.803 558.662,73.347 C557.607,73.757 556.021,74.244 553.102,74.378 C549.944,74.521 548.997,74.552 541,74.552 C533.003,74.552 532.056,74.521 528.898,74.378 C525.979,74.244 524.393,73.757 523.338,73.347 C521.94,72.803 520.942,72.155 519.894,71.106 C518.846,70.057 518.197,69.06 517.654,67.663 C517.244,66.606 516.755,65.022 516.623,62.101 C516.479,58.943 516.448,57.996 516.448,50 C516.448,42.003 516.479,41.056 516.623,37.899 C516.755,34.978 517.244,33.391 517.654,32.338 C518.197,30.938 518.846,29.942 519.894,28.894 C520.942,27.846 521.94,27.196 523.338,26.654 C524.393,26.244 525.979,25.756 528.898,25.623 C532.057,25.479 533.004,25.448 541,25.448 C548.997,25.448 549.943,25.479 553.102,25.623 C556.021,25.756 557.607,26.244 558.662,26.654 C560.06,27.196 561.058,27.846 562.106,28.894 C563.154,29.942 563.803,30.938 564.346,32.338 C564.756,33.391 565.244,34.978 565.378,37.899 C565.522,41.056 565.552,42.003 565.552,50 C565.552,57.996 565.522,58.943 565.378,62.101 M570.82,37.631 C570.674,34.438 570.167,32.258 569.425,30.349 C568.659,28.377 567.633,26.702 565.965,25.035 C564.297,23.368 562.623,22.342 560.652,21.575 C558.743,20.834 556.562,20.326 553.369,20.18 C550.169,20.033 549.148,20 541,20 C532.853,20 531.831,20.033 528.631,20.18 C525.438,20.326 523.257,20.834 521.349,21.575 C519.376,22.342 517.703,23.368 516.035,25.035 C514.368,26.702 513.342,28.377 512.574,30.349 C511.834,32.258 511.326,34.438 511.181,37.631 C511.035,40.831 511,41.851 511,50 C511,58.147 511.035,59.17 511.181,62.369 C511.326,65.562 511.834,67.743 512.574,69.651 C513.342,71.625 514.368,73.296 516.035,74.965 C517.703,76.634 519.376,77.658 521.349,78.425 C523.257,79.167 525.438,79.673 528.631,79.82 C531.831,79.965 532.853,80.001 541,80.001 C549.148,80.001 550.169,79.965 553.369,79.82 C556.562,79.673 558.743,79.167 560.652,78.425 C562.623,77.658 564.297,76.634 565.965,74.965 C567.633,73.296 568.659,71.625 569.425,69.651 C570.167,67.743 570.674,65.562 570.82,62.369 C570.966,59.17 571,58.147 571,50 C571,41.851 570.966,40.831 570.82,37.631\"></path></g></g></g></svg></div><div > <div >View this post on Instagram</div></div><div ></div> <div ><div> <div ></div> <div ></div> <div ></div></div><div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div><div > <div ></div> <div ></div> <div ></div></div></div> <div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div></a><p ><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CaHPUviLdEd/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"  target=\"_blank\">A post shared by ye (@kanyewest)</a></p></div></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script></div></div><p id=\"NBS3QR\">Having control over the hardware platform the music is tied to may make this a different environment for the release. The artist has continued to post on Instagram since last night’s announcement — older posts about Pete Davidson, Billie Eilish, and Kid Cudi have disappeared — sharing what appears to be a tracklist for Donda 2 and reiterating a recent claim that Apple offered to pay $100 million for the first Donda album. </p><p id=\"kTUFaQ\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CaHOHnSLizi/\">According to Ye</a>, “Tech companies made music practically free so if you don’t do merch sneakers and tours you don’t eat. Jay Z made Tidal and fake media attacked him. Well in the words of my big brother. Come and get me. I’m willing to die standing cause I ain’t living on my knees no more. God please cover me. I run this company 100% I don’t have to ask for permission. This is our 2nd generation stemplayer We have more things we working on. I feel like how I felt in the first episode of the documentary.” The documentary he mentions is <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/jeen-yuhs-review-kanye-west-documentary\"><em>Jeen-yuhs</em></a>, which recently debuted on Netflix.</p>",
