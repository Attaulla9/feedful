Charlie Cox brought his Daredevil character into <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>, while Vincent D’Onofrio played Kingpin in the <em>Hawkeye </em>show on Disney Plus. </p><p id=\"hqv8Zw\">This brings an end to the partnership that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/4/3727688/netflix-streaming-rights-new-disney-marvel-pixar-movies\">started in 2012</a> and first hit our TV screens with the premiere of <em>Daredevil</em> on Netflix in 2015. By 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/18/18229507/jessica-jones-punisher-netflix-canceled-iron-fist-daredevil-luke-cage-defenders-disney\">all of the shows had been canceled</a>, leaving them in limbo ever since. As now Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos pointed out in a 2017 interview with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-netflix-idUSKBN1AR0V0\"><em>Reuters</em></a>, “[t]hat’s why we got into the originals business five years ago.” </p><p id=\"Q71HGg\">There’s no word from either party involved about what might happen to the shows after they leave Netflix, and while my guess is that they will make a return in some form, somewhere, you may want to enjoy them over the next few weeks while you still can.</p>",
