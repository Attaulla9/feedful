After <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused\">having to pull an earlier update</a> that caused a rash of bugs and connectivity issues for early buyers of the phones, Google tried to get back on track by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884219/google-january-2022-pixel-6-pro-update\">taking its time with the January update</a>. That seemed to go okay, and yesterday, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/7/22922128/google-pixel-6-pro-5-4-update-february-patch-fixes\">both received the February software release</a> (with more bug fixes in tow) right alongside older models, and it looked like everything was getting back to normal.</p><p id=\"elPULO\">Not quite.</p><p id=\"c2egrd\">Yet again, there are initial reports of problems with the February update that are specifically affecting the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro and leaving other Pixels unscathed. According to numerous reports on Twitter and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/sn71f5/feb_update_wifi_issues/\">Reddit</a> — and as noted by <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-6-owners-report-wi-fi-issues-after-installing-the-february-2022-patch/\"><em>Android Police</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-february-update-wi-fi-bluetooth-bugs\"><em>Android Central</em></a> — the latest nasty bug causes Wi-Fi to randomly be switched off on Google’s flagship phones. Other owners are seeing a bizarre and frustrating link between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth; when one is enabled, the other turns off and vice versa. </p><aside id=\"H47FRS\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Google’s Android 12 update has been the rockiest in years\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22881882/android-12-google-pixel-6-pro-bugs-oneplus-oxygenos-12-samsung-one-ui-4-update\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"imCGK0\">It’s worth emphasizing that not everyone is encountering these issues; there are Pixel 6 and 6 Pro owners on Reddit (and on <em>Verge</em> editorial staff) confirming that the February patch successfully installed without producing any negative side effects. But for those who <em>are</em> having a bad experience post-update, these can be show-stopping bugs that hinder fundamental phone functionality.  </p><p id=\"lg781V\">Prompt and frequent software updates have traditionally been a major selling point for Pixel phones, and feature drops continue to add useful new capabilities. But the consistent issues with Pixel 6 and 6 Pro updates can’t be overlooked; whether it’s Google still getting accustomed to its Tensor silicon or subpar quality assurance testing, something seems to have gone amiss. </p><p id=\"a8MQBE\"><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Google for comment. For now, the February security patch for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro remains available. </p>",
