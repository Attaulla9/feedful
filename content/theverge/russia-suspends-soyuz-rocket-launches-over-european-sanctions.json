Arianespace was on track to launch two Galileo satellites into orbit using a Soyuz rocket in April, however, that will likely be pushed back due to growing tensions among nations. The US and Europe have put <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/business/list-global-sanctions-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/index.html\">a slew of sanctions on Russia</a> since its invasion into Ukraine, and have also moved to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22949156/russia-expelled-swift-ukraine-sanctions\">exclude some Russian banks from SWIFT</a>. </p><p id=\"nbvDo4\">“I confirm that this decision has no consequences on the continuity and quality of the Galileo and Copernicus services,” Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for Space <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/breton/announcements/statement-thierry-breton-european-commissioner-space-following-decision-roscosmos-withdraw-guiana_en\">said in a statement</a>. “Nor does this decision put the continued development of these infrastructures at risk.”</p><p id=\"WEvbcH\">Russia and Europe have been readying for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176384/european-space-agency-russia-rover-delay-exomars-testing\">a robotic mission to Mars</a> set to take place this year. European Space Agency director Josef Aschbacher says the “ESA continues to work on all of its programmers, including on ISS &amp; EXOMars launch campaign,” but will “continue to monitor the evolving situation.”</p><p id=\"I7LgCG\">In addition to temporarily cutting ties with Arianespace, Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin has decided to exclude the US from <a href=\"https://www.space.com/35333-russia-nasa-venus-mission-venera-d.html\">a joint mission to explore Venus</a>, called Venera-D. Early Saturday morning, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1497473032813690884\">Rogozin said</a> he considers “the continued participation of the United States” in Russia’s Venera-D mission “inappropriate” in light of the sanctions it put on Russia. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950498/russia-nasa-international-space-station-dmitry-rogozin-roscosmos-ukraine-iss\">Rogozin also claims</a> these sanctions will ruin relations between Russia and NASA, potentially leading to the downfall of the International Space Station.</p><aside id=\"aPYKoy\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"US and Russia still tethered by International Space Station during Ukraine conflict\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22947884/nasa-russia-space-cooperation-international-space-station-invasion\"}]}'></div></aside>",
