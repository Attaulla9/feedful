So games like <em>Call of Duty</em> are increasingly looking for ways to make it less fun for people to exploit their games — and the latest idea gives honest players a cheat of their own. The new “Damage Shield” in <em>Call of Duty</em> <em>Warzone</em>’s new Ricochet anti-cheat software makes a cheater’s bullets bounce right off you, so you can close in while they hilariously flail around and then destroy them yourself. </p><p id=\"QCtkah\">You can see YouTuber TimTheTatman show it off right here, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3CvQaskBsA8?t=113\">roughly a minute and 13 seconds into this video</a>: </p><div id=\"GcTob9\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3CvQaskBsA8?rel=0&amp;start=113\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"Ujjq1Q\"><a href=\"https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/02/call-of-duty-warzone-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-two-update\">In a blog post</a> announcing the feature, Activision says it only activates “when the server detects a cheater is tampering with the game in real-time,” and that there’s “no possibility for the game to apply a Damage Shield randomly or by accident,” in case you’re wondering about that. </p><p id=\"b2Z8Jk\">“We will never interfere in gunfights between law-abiding community members,” Activision adds. So if you see this happening when you’re not cheating, well, you’ll probably have questions.</p><p id=\"dswSnv\">The company’s also putting cheaters on notice that it’ll begin banning them across the entire <em>Call of Duty</em> gaming franchise, not just on a game-by-game basis, and that bans will extend to future <em>Call of Duty</em> games as well. It writes:</p><blockquote><p id=\"9Aocfo\">Going forward, extreme, or repeated violations of the security policy – such as in-game cheating – may result in a permanent suspension of all accounts. Additionally, any attempt to hide, disguise, or obfuscate your identity or the identity of your hardware devices may also result in a permanent suspension.</p></blockquote><p id=\"0kiBTo\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem\">Cheating has increasingly become a scourge on gaming</a> over the past couple of years, leaving no popular game untouched, to the point that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261947/call-of-duty-warzone-cheaters-hackers-aimbots-wallhacks-problem\">pro gamers wound up abandoning some titles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22868220/xbox-forced-crossplay-warzone-halo-infinite-issues\">console players are rejecting cross-play with PC</a> because of the prevalence of cheaters there. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney\">Epic won’t update <em>Fortnite</em> to run on the Steam Deck</a> for fear of cheaters as well. </p><p id=\"W2TILO\">Companies like Activision have been reacting with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632554/call-of-duty-warzone-vanguard-raven-new-map-destiny-2-anti-cheat\">huge new anti-cheating initiatives</a>, including their <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver\">own original kernel-level drivers for PC</a>, but they’re also fighting cheats with legal action, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867724/activision-sues-call-of-duty-cheats-company-engineowning\">suing</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408867/cheat-maker-cxcheat-call-of-duty-sales-shutdown-activision\">threatening to sue</a> their makers into the ground. </p><p id=\"08W3Ms\">Trolling cheaters is also a fun tactic, though. In addition to the new Call of Duty shield, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18019682/league-of-legends-cheating-botting-scripting-boosting\">we’ve seen <em>League of Legends</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apex-legends-cheaters-will-fight-each-other/\"><em>Apex Legends </em>developers</a> suggest they would make cheaters exclusively fight one another, condemned to battle it out in cheater hell.</p><p id=\"zc1K9r\"></p><p id=\"L1R2Cw\"></p>",
