From there, they can choose a moderator from a list of suggested accounts, or use the search bar to search for a specific account.</p><p id=\"mb6QTf\">Live has been around <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/12/13921624/instagram-live-video-now-available-android-iphone\">since 2016</a>, and with that in mind, it comes as a bit of shock that Instagram has only just now started supporting moderators for its streams. Moderation has become a much-needed staple on other livestreaming platforms, like Twitch and YouTube, where comments can quickly get ugly. Even Instagram’s sister company, Facebook, gives users <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/410499652805623?id=648321075955172\">the ability to add mods</a> to their streams and also <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/30/facebook-gaming-launches-tools-for-streamers-to-deal-with-trolls/\">added tools to remove trolls</a> — just like the moderation features Instagram just launched.</p><p id=\"4rorEu\">As Instagram attempts to attract more creators to Live with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22776064/instagram-live-badges-creator-support-launch-us-comments-questions-livestreams\">the ability to monetize streams</a>, the availability of chat moderators should hopefully make the streaming experience a lot more pleasant for creators.</p>",
