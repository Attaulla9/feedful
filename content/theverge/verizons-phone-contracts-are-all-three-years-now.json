As reported by <a href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2022/02/03/verizon-36-month-device-payment-contract/\"><em>Droid Life</em></a> (via <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/paying-off-your-new-verizon-phone-will-now-take-3-years/\"><em>Android Police</em></a>), Verizon appears to have gotten rid of its 24- and 30-month contracts for all devices — including phones, hot spots, and smartwatches — and has instead extended it to 36 months.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"oC0MW6\"><q>Unless you can pay off the entire device, you’re locked into the three-year plan</q></aside></div><p id=\"e8yfW3\">Verizon’s <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/device-payment-faqs/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">payment program FAQ page</a> explains that there isn’t any interest attached to the 36-month plan, and you can choose to pay off the phone in full whenever you want. What you can’t do, however, is pay more than your set monthly installment — so unless you can pay off the entire device, you’re locked into the three-year plan. If you’ve agreed to a 24- or 30-month plan before February 3rd, 2022, Verizon says you won’t be affected by this change.</p><p id=\"Fhcr1B\">As phones get more expensive, with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review\">more</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review\">than</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes\">a few</a> crossing into $1,000 territory, it’s no longer uncommon for us to want to hold onto our smartphones for several years. Plus, a number of phone manufacturers still roll out updates several years after a phone’s release, killing the urge to upgrade our devices (at least for some of us). As a bit of a recap, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates\">Samsung phones get security updates</a> for four additional years, Apple provides <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility\">updates on devices for five to seven years</a>, and Google offers updates on the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?\">Pixel 6 and 6 Pro for five years</a>. But not all phone companies are so generous (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/motorola-software-updates-rant/\"><em>looking at you, Motorola</em></a>), so you might want to look into your phone’s software update policy before you’re locked into a three-year contract.</p><p id=\"bUCRhZ\">That said, it’s unclear when exactly Verizon shifted towards longer contracts, but it seems like it’s a little late to the game. AT&amp;T has already gotten on board with the idea, as the company started <a href=\"https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-offers-36-month-eip\">offering just three-year contracts</a> last year. And while <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17990192/tmobile-36-month-payment-official-launching-g7-samsung-galaxy-payment\">T-Mobile started experimenting with the idea of 36-month plans</a> in 2018, it has since gone back to offering only 24- or 30-month plans.</p>",
