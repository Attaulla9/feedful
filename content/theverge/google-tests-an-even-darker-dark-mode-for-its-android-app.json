This new shade still isn’t the same as the one presented in Google’s test of a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/22/22945940/google-dark-mode-pitch-black-search\">pitch-black dark mode</a> on desktops last month. Rather, the one spotted in the mobile app is darker than the usual dark gray but still lighter than pitch black. I momentarily had the pitch-black search page on desktop, but shortly after, it switched back to dark gray.</p><p id=\"zUrVhy\">The new dark mode in Google’s mobile app could be more attractive for devices with OLED displays looking to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18076502/google-dark-mode-android-battery-life\">save battery life</a>, or who just prefer to use dark mode more. <em>Android Police</em> said that the new shade is available Google’s latest 13.8 beta in the Google Play Store which you can get<em> </em>via <a href=\"https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-search/google-search-13-8-7-release/\">APKMirror</a>, an archive that allows Android users to download items not readily available on their device, or go the official route <a href=\"https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox/join\">by joining the beta test group</a>. </p><p id=\"HjuS4Q\">After Google <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276553/google-search-dark-mode-desktop\">confirmed that it was testing</a> dark mode on desktops last year, the company confirmed a wide rollout of dark mode for Google Search in February for its desktop users. Though you can access the app’s new color shade on your own, a wider release could take months to get to more people officially, much like the desktop release we just saw. </p><aside id=\"uLr8W9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How to enable dark mode on your phone, laptop, and more\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18270975/how-to-dark-mode-iphone-android-mac-windows-xbox-ps4-nintendo-switch\"}]}'></div></aside>",
