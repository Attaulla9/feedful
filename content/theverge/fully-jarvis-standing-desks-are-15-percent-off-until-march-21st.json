Check out these deals</h2><p id=\"BNPoD0\">This wireless ergonomic mouse and keyboard combo from Microsoft is currently discounted at Best Buy. This bundle would normally cost $129.99 but is <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cfUybZYyYRs\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently down to $89.99</a>. These uniquely-shaped accessories are designed to help cut down on wrist strain.

Purchased separately, the Logitech MX Master 3 wireless mouse and MX Keys keyboard sell for $219.98. However, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgJCuB71Xpb\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if you purchase them as a bundle through Best Buy you can bring both home for $209.98</a>. It’s not a sizeable discount by any means, but it’s a deal worth looking into, as neither of these peripherals has been subject to a price break lately.</p><p id=\"3uHpVa\">The MX Keys keyboard can pair with Windows or Apple devices via Bluetooth or 2.4 GHz wireless, and it even features Mac commands on its keys. The MX Master 3 mouse is equipped with a number of easily reachable buttons and scroll wheels that can be remapped to a variety of functions based on whatever project you’re working on. And the free-spinning scroll wheel lets you fly through large pages with a single flick.</p><div id=\"jJZlSo\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11073548\"></div></div><h2 id=\"cDFgYU\"> Some other deals you should check out</h2><ul><li id=\"J2JkY1\">While the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 series just launched, you can currently <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgI92vCI6rE\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">get a gift card with a value of $100 when you purchase a Tab S8 Ultra model from Best Buy</a>.
