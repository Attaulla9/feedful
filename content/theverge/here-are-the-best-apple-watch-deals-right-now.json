It might be tempting to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features\">order one of the Series 7 models</a>, but new hardware always comes at a premium. Apple’s latest wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. </p><p id=\"sxsAXI\">Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?</p><p id=\"FtR5HF\">There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021\">watchOS 8</a>. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399 as well. If either of those models seems too expensive, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.</p><p id=\"44jktU\">Finally, there’s the aging <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review\">Series 3</a>, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.</p><aside id=\"Yen8lP\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals\"},{\"title\":\"Here are the best iPad deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"hdRa4b\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10741666\"></div></div><h2 id=\"OlUIlK\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review\">Apple Watch Series 3</a> deals</h2><p id=\"c2iEiy\">The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a decent entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and solid build quality — especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range — but it’s also not one we would recommend picking up at this point. The design is aging, the processor is slower, and its paltry 8GB of internal storage hampers some of the more recent features introduced to the Apple Watch, like the ability to store music and podcasts for offline listening.</p><p id=\"DSKChG\">If you still want to go this route, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Gen-3-Series-3-38mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Black-Sport-Band-MTF02LL-A%2F706203065%3F&amp;veh=aff\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to $169</a>. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s also on sale in <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">white and black at Walmart for $199</a> instead of $229. </p><div id=\"N8sVLO\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9514914\"></div></div><div id=\"zc5j8W\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10741240\"></div></div><h2 id=\"3G29qi\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features\">Apple Watch SE</a> deals</h2><p id=\"GaARPa\">Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.</p><p id=\"2ryWZk\">We’ve previously seen the base model of the Apple Watch SE go on sale for as low as $219. At the moment, however, the 40mm, GPS-equipped configuration is only available for around $270 ($9 off) at Walmart and Amazon. Right now, you can pick up the discounted model with a silver case and a blue Sport Band (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F305879066&amp;subid1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals2142022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>), a gold case and a white Sport Band (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B09G9FS5YN/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F758438118&amp;subid1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals2142022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>), or a space gray case with a black Sport Band (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B09G96SSLB?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F645876604&amp;subid1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals2142022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>).

The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.</p><div id=\"PfLoQg\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9432291\"></div></div><p id=\"dWTk3x\">Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6.

These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches also don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models.</p><aside id=\"hjNY0P\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
