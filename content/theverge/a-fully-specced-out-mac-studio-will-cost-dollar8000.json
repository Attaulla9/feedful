But the Mac Studio’s power doesn’t come cheap: while it starts at $1,999 for the entry model (powered by an M1 Max chip) and $3,999 for the cheapest M1 Ultra version, getting a fully specced-out machine will set you back an eye-watering $7,999. </p><p id=\"PlheGG\">You’re getting some serious bang for your buck, at least (which it had better, given that it costs more than a 2011 Honda Accord): an M1 Ultra processor with the full 20-core CPU and 64-core GPU configuration (instead of the 48-core GPU on the “base” M1 Ultra), 128GB of memory, and an 8TB SSD. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQ0GzX0rBuJqh4ZylN1g2UUrPZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298846/Screen_Shot_2022_03_08_at_2.31.47_PM.png\">  </figure><p id=\"rx47P3\">Starting from the $3,999 base price for the M1 Ultra-equipped Mac Studio, here’s how those add-ons shake out: adding more GPU cores adds $1,000 to the price, and doubling RAM from 64GB to 128GB is an extra $800. The bulk of the added price tag comes from SSD storage, though, which starts at 1TB for the base model but rises fast with the 2TB ($400 more), 4TB ($1,000 more), or 8TB ($2,200 more) options. </p><p id=\"9k4foF\">Add in everything, and you’ll get the maximum $7,999 price — more expensive than <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733173/macbook-pro-specced-out-high-end-price\">the top-specced MacBook Pro</a>, for instance, which costs $6,099 for an M1 Max chip, 64GB of RAM, and a similar 8TB SSD. </p><p id=\"fOiHvH\">That price still doesn’t factor in software (like Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro, which Apple will bundle in for $299.99 or $199.99, respectively) or accessories (like a mouse, keyboard, or a monitor). </p><p id=\"j967Jx\">For argument’s sake, let’s say you want the complete Apple hardware package, though. That adds $199 for a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, $149 for a Magic Trackpad, and $1,599 for a matching Studio Display (which Apple announced alongside the Mac Studio), putting our total at $9,947. </p><p id=\"3QLFxk\"><em>Except</em> the Mac Studio can support up to <em>four</em> Studio Displays at one time, so you’ll probably want to add in another three monitors (which are, again, $1,599 each), which makes our new tally $14,744. (That doesn’t factor in the optional, height- and tilt-adjustable stands for those monitors, either, which cost $400 a pop, or the nano-coated texture for $300 each.) You could also add a fifth display to connect through HDMI, although Apple doesn’t make one of those, so you’ll have to turn to a different company for that. </p><p id=\"p41kI4\">That said, you’re still coming out <em>way</em> ahead of Apple’s 2019 Mac Pro model, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/10/21003636/apple-mac-pro-price-most-expensive-processor-ram-gpu\">which costs $53,799 for a fully specced model</a> (not counting Apple’s absurdly expensive $4,999 Pro Display XDR and its $1,000 stand). Although with Apple already promising news of an Apple silicon-powered Mac Pro coming in the near future, it’s possible we’ll get a new champion for an even<em> more </em>expensive Mac computer soon.  </p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"31RDQ3\"><h2 id=\"iIieCO\">Related:</h2><div id=\"nfhDwG\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Apple March 2022|106185\" data-volume-uuid=\"d46b6b1e2\" data-volume-id=\"106185\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-157\" class=\"volume-video\"></div></div>",
