According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaurenKGurley/status/1499188237201551360?s=20&amp;t=usz5DNPjWwZ76AHGYkKi0A\">a screenshot posted</a> by <em>Vice</em> reporter Lauren Kaori Gurley, Amazon has acknowledged the decision in a message sent to employees through its A to Z app.</p><p id=\"6mWI85\">The Amazon Labor Union, or ALU, has been working to unionize the facility for a while — in October it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738310/amazon-warehouse-workers-staten-island-union-election-nlrb\">filed a petition</a> to unionize Amazon’s facilities on Staten Island, but later <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850880/amazon-workers-staten-island-refile-union-petition\">refiled that petition to focus on a single warehouse</a>, JFK8. Workers at JFK8 have since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22903584/amazon-jfk8-warehouse-union-election-labor-nlrb\">gotten approval</a> to hold an election <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937440/amazon-jfk8-staten-island-union-election-march-25th\">starting on March 25th</a>. After the ALU <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914807/amazon-workers-warehouse-nyc-petition-nlrb-union-organize\">filed a petition for LDJ5</a>, the NLRB said it would confirm it “met the showing of interest requirement to proceed with a union election.”</p><div id=\"jJjuZ7\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here's confirmation message that Amazon just texted to its workers in Staten Island with Amazon's typical rhetoric about what unions can't do. <a href=\"https://t.co/cc3lKv09au\">pic.twitter.com/cc3lKv09au</a></p>— Lauren Kaori Gurley (@LaurenKGurley) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaurenKGurley/status/1499188237201551360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 3, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"IVXo8c\">A spokesperson for the NLRB could not immediately confirm that the approval had been granted, and Amazon did not immediately reply to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment. However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amazonlabor/status/1499197669733978114?s=20&amp;t=TUlb6wN5RNLAQVbAsvKb0A\">the ALU claims</a> it’s received that approval. Based on the process for JFK8, the next step will be an NLRB hearing, after which specifics and dates for the election would be decided. </p><p id=\"3AWXR8\">Amazon has previously been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22905235/nlrb-amazon-broke-labor-laws-jfk8-warehouse-workers\">accused of anti-union actions in New York</a>, with the NLRB alleging that it threatened, surveilled, and interrogated workers.</p><p id=\"dFzjtN\">There are two other Amazon facilities involved in union elections. In addition to JFK8, Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama facility <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878457/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-election-redo-february-fourth\">recently held its election redo</a>, after the NLRB decided that Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive\">had interfered with the first one</a>. Election officials for the Bessemer union drive are scheduled to start counting votes on March 28th, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/02/04/1077089349/amazon-union-vote-alabama\">according to NPR</a>. In the original election, the vote was 1,798 to 738 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1\">in Amazon’s favor</a>.</p><p id=\"gF8ALO\"></p><p id=\"lGENIK\"></p>",
