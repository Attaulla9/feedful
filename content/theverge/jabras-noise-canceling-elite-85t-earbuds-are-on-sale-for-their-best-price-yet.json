Although the Elite 85t are not Jabra’s newest model, they still offer good noise cancellation, solid on-earbud controls, and the ability to pair with two devices simultaneously, a feature many true wireless earbuds still lack. They also come with a case that charges wirelessly or via USB-C, and they carry an IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance. <a href=\"https://link.theverge.com/click/27000341.1833/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTQ5NTg3L2phYnJhLWVsaXRlLTg1dC1yZXZpZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtc3BlY3MtcHJpY2U/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aBe8634177\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><div id=\"pM55UK\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11089769\"></div></div><aside id=\"pY2IW6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds\"},{\"title\":\"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"eMK3qf\">The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is a capable device, but it can’t do it all. Luckily, there are accessories like Apple’s well-made Magic Keyboard, which allows you to transform your 12.9-inch iPad Pro into something more akin to a traditional laptop. The latest model can accommodate the thicker, 2021 iPad Pro — as well as the third, fourth, and fifth-gen models — but, otherwise, the sturdy keyboard case shares the same design as the previous model, providing both an excellent trackpad and a backlit keyboard that’s comfortable to type on. </p><p id=\"4yC5Pe\">Normally $349, Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09322LR1R?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on now sale in white at Amazon for $293</a>, its best price to date. The retailer is also discounting the keyboard case in other configurations, including one that’s compatible with the 11-inch iPad Pro, the 2020 iPad Air, and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22961680/apple-ipad-air-2022-release-date-price-features-specs-m1\">forthcoming iPad Air with Apple’s M1 chip</a>.

While we’ve seen the fourth-gen model go for as low as $169.99 in the past, this is the lowest price either retailer has sold it for this year. The small, Alexa-enabled lock is compatible with most US deadbolt locks and is easier to set up and install than its predecessor. Plus, unlike the bigger last-gen model, it doesn’t require an external bridge for connectivity — you just need to add the lock to your existing Wi-Fi network through the August smartphone app. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21255026/august-wifi-smart-lock-review-test-price-specs-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"2UZL5t\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9758101\"></div></div><p id=\"PAFkL2\">If you don’t need a lot of horsepower or storage when it comes to computing, Asus’s Chromebook Detachable CM3 — our pick for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best detachable Chromebook</a> — is on sale today for its best price to date.
