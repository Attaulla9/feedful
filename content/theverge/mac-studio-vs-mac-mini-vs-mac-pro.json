As you might expect, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22962081/apple-mac-studio-m1-max-ultra-price-specs-processor-release-date\">the new Mac Studio</a> can be equipped with either the M1 Max or the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22958174/apple-silicon-m1-ultra-chip-soc-processor-cpu-gpu-update\">new M1 Ultra CPU</a>. In addition to a new processor, the Mac Studio boasts an impressive number of connectivity options.</p><p id=\"LSNDen\">The Mac Studio bears a striking resemblance to the 2020 version of the Mac Mini. According to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review\">our review</a> by Chris Welch, this model of the Mac Mini offered an “appealing price for the power it offers.” And thanks in part to the M1 CPU, provided “blazing performance.”</p><p id=\"u7FXlN\">On the other end of the spectrum is the Apple Mac Pro, which debuted in 2019 and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video\">was reviewed</a> by <em>The Verge’s </em>own Nilay Patel. That incredibly expensive desktop brought a curious, yet distinctive appearance, marketed towards power users that can effectively harness the power it brings to the table.</p><p id=\"MbWwb9\">For a more comprehensive breakdown, we’ve included a chart below that shows how the brand new M1 Max and M1 Ultra configurations of the Mac Studio stack up against the M1 model of the Mac Mini and the monolithic Mac Pro.</p><div id=\"uENyh5\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:11084044\"></div></div><p id=\"pUTCms\">While the announcement of the Mac Studio and the M1 Ultra processor clearly stole the show, Apple also announced <a href=\"https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/5a358581-cc4e-4630-ba62-04561d0eeb2a\">a new display</a>, as well as a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/22723733\">iPhone SE</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/22722942\">iPad Air</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/22729605\">We’ve also put together a summary of the event</a> if you’re just curious about the highlights.</p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"wX7g0R\"><h2 id=\"9EaSzX\">Related:</h2><div id=\"pL8Eze\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Apple March 2022|106185\" data-volume-uuid=\"d46b6b1e2\" data-volume-id=\"106185\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-817\" class=\"volume-video\"></div></div>",
