Truth Social will be his second attempt at making some kind of new platform; he launched a blog <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419850/donald-trump-social-media-platform-ban-twitter-facebook\">in May</a>, but it was shut down <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464930/donald-trump-blog-facebook-twitter-social-media-platform\">in less than a month</a>. The new app is being made by the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), Trump’s media company helmed by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821450/devin-nunes-ceo-tmtg-spac-dwac-truth-social-media\">former US Rep. Devin Nunes</a>.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"lyBXXH\"><q>Truth Social has rolled out to about 500 beta testers</q></aside></div><p id=\"kLHDNE\">While the shifting date could suggest the app is having some development troubles, it has already rolled out to about 500 beta testers, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-trump-app-opens-hundreds-testers-ahead-expected-launch-2022-02-17/\">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820389/sec-trump-spac-deal-investigation-truth-social-media-platform-public\">investigating the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)</a> that intends to take TMTG public, which may also be a reason for the delay.</p><p id=\"98Ew7a\">It appears Trump is one of the Truth Social beta testers and has made his first post — though he can’t share that information on Twitter himself. Donald Trump Jr., who still has Twitter privileges, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1493713461452410885\">tweeted a screenshot</a> of Trump’s first Truth Social post instead: “Get Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!”</p><p id=\"oWEwm2\">According to <em>Reuters</em>, Trump’s Truth Social account had 317 followers as of late Wednesday. Trump had 88 million followers on Twitter at the time he was banned. </p><p id=\"qzY9kI\">TMTG didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment about the app’s launch date. It’s unclear if the app will be available on non-iOS platforms, though you can join a waiting list on the <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/\">Truth Social website</a>.</p><aside id=\"7IOv8u\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Donald Trump’s new social media SPAC, explained\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738240/donald-trump-truth-social-spac-dwac-stock-merger\"},{\"title\":\"SEC investigating Trump SPAC deal to take his social media platform public\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820389/sec-trump-spac-deal-investigation-truth-social-media-platform-public\"}]}'></div></aside>",
