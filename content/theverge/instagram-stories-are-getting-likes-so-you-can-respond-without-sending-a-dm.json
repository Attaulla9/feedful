Previously, any response you sent to someone about a Story — whether it was an emoji or a full-on message — showed up as a response in their DM inbox; with this new feature, you can show some appreciation for a Story without clogging up the user’s DMs.</p><p id=\"qnEZnd\">“So now, as you go through Stories, between send message and that little paper airplane, there will be a heart icon,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1493299070823141379\">Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in a video</a>. “And if you tap on it, it’ll send the author of that story a like, and that like will show up in the viewer sheet, not in your DM thread with them.” </p><div id=\"BpK5an\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">❤️ Private Story Likes ❤️<br><br>Starting to roll out today, you can now send some love by liking people’s stories without sending a DM. <br><br>Likes on stories are private and do not have counts. Rather, they appear as hearts next to people’s handles in your Stories view sheet.    <a href=\"https://t.co/l56Rmzgnnw\">pic.twitter.com/l56Rmzgnnw</a></p>— Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1493299070823141379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 14, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"IivQbm\">Notably, Stories will not have like counts, which is a largely different approach than what Instagram has chosen for users’ main feeds. Instagram (which now falls under the umbrella of Meta) spent more than two years <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523847/instagram-hide-likes-test-canada\">testing hiding like counts</a> on the main feed before <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456206/instagram-hiding-likes-experiment-results-platformer\">making the decision to leave them on by default</a>, though users can opt to hide them on their posts.</p><p id=\"hiORv8\">For likes on Stories, you won’t see a public count, though you can see who left a like on your Stories when you look at a Story’s view sheet. “The idea here is make sure that people can express more support for each other, but also to clean up DMs a little bit,” Mosseri said.</p>",
