Ubisoft hasn’t said who might be responsible, but on Friday evening, the group who purportedly hacked Nvidia took credit.</p><p id=\"PgsOwo\">Ubisoft said it believes that “at this time there is no evidence any player personal information was accessed or exposed as a by-product of this incident” and says that games and services are now “functioning normally.” Out of caution, the company also “initiated a company-wide password reset.” When asked for comment, Ubisoft spokesperson Jessica Roache said the company had no additional details to share.</p><p id=\"VPFy2J\">News of the incident arrives amid a recent wave of high-profile hacks. Nvidia confirmed on March 1st that it was hacked and <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-confirms-company-data-was-stolen-in-hack\">said that</a> the hackers are leaking employee credentials and proprietary information. Samsung said on March 7th that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/7/22965220/samsung-hack-lapsus-galaxy-source-code-confirmed-nvidia\">hackers stole</a> internal company data and source code for Galaxy devices. The LAPSUS$ hacking group has taken responsibility for those two breaches. </p><p id=\"EDZVvs\">But that may not be all. On Friday, in a Telegram channel allegedly run by LAPSUS$, the group posted a link to this article and the <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/smirking-face/\">smirking face emoji</a>, seemingly taking responsibility for the Ubisoft incident, too. In response to a user in the channel, the group “confirmed” that it did not target Ubisoft’s customer information. Ubisoft didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on the claims.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UjQXCcVk7SyDZiD7rvfDOSPUZuc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23308189/Screen_Shot_2022_03_11_at_4.08.20_PM.png\">      <figcaption><em>Here is a screenshot sent by a tipster of the Telegram channel. </em>The Verge<em> separately saw the messages in the channel as well.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"NJQ64p\"><em><strong>Update March 11th, 7:36PM ET</strong></em><em>: Added that a group allegedly representing LAPSUS$ is taking credit.</em></p>",
