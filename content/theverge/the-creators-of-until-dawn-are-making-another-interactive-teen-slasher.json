It’ll also feature a multiplayer aspect: there’s a co-op mode where two players control different characters, and a mode for up to seven players where everyone can vote on the choices made.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9G8zu0Q9RrtsM5IFTC-DTKlfDI0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23320388/The_Quarry___Screenshot___Scared_Camp_Counselors.png\">      <cite>Image: Supermassive Games</cite>  </figure><p id=\"NFJFAy\"><em>Until Dawn</em> made a splash in 2015 by essentially being an interactive horror movie, where players could make choices in an attempt to keep characters alive through the night. It was also notable for its celebrity cast, which will continue in <em>The Quarry</em>. The game stars David Arquette, Ariel Winter, Justice Smith, Brenda Song, Lance Henriksen, and Lin Shaye. It also introduces a new “movie” mode where you don’t even have to make choices, and can just watch events play out.</p><p id=\"XO8cgC\"><em>The Quarry </em>is slated to launch on June 10th on the PS4, PS5, Xbox, and Steam.</p>",
