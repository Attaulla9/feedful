The automaker originally predicted it wouldn’t start building Bolts until <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814089/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-shutdown-sales-2022\">at least the end of January 2022</a>.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"GdPPGU\"><q>GM paused production of all Bolts last August</q></aside></div><p id=\"YCepef\">“GM will resume production at its Orion Township, MI, plant the week of April 4, 2022,” GM spokesperson Dan Flores said in a statement obtained by <em>The Detroit News</em>. “We remain committed to Bolt EV and EUV and this decision will allow us to simultaneously replace battery modules and resume retail sales soon, which were strong before the recall.”</p><p id=\"Q8oS5t\">Recalls for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem\">the 2017-2019 Chevy Bolt started in 2020</a> following reports of the car catching fire, and they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix\">were recalled for a second time last July</a>.
