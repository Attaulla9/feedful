But the most interesting discovery relates to the vibration motor inside the S22 devices, which <em>iFixit </em>notes is now built into the bottom speaker rather than the top.</p><p id=\"yb16Og\">The speculation is that Samsung is trying to catch up to the performance of the iPhone’s Taptic Engine, but it’s doing so with a component that takes up less internal space. The changes Samsung has made to the vibration motor were actually picked up on by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qWIkBMNKj1s?t=391\">Marques Brownlee in his review</a>, although he found it made the vibration harder to notice while the S22 was in his pocket. Bummer.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6iWvHQCrUpjfnF4-CG1in9UZYJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23287725/Galaxy_S22_Ultra_internals_blog_1365x2048.jpg\">      <cite>Image: iFixit</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Galaxy S22 Ultra (left) and the regular S22.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"Bl4BVr\">Unfortunately, Samsung’s flagship phones are still a bit of a nightmare to repair, which is bad news for device longevity and hence the environment. Although the internals of both phones are held together with standard Philips-head screws, their casings are stuck together with tough adhesive that’s difficult to tease apart (<em>iFixit</em> actually cracks the back of its S22 Ultra during removal), and their batteries take “a tedious combo of isopropyl alcohol, suction cup lifting force, and patience” to remove and replace. </p><p id=\"85TqZU\">The result is a pair of three out of 10 scores for reparability, which is the same as last year’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FSamsung%2BGalaxy%2BS21%2BUltra%2BTeardown%2F141188&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F4%2F22961325%2Fifixit-galaxy-s22-ultra-teardown-repairability-s-pen-stylus\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">S21 Ultra</a> but represents a slight fall for the base <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FSamsung%2BGalaxy%2BS21%2BTeardown%2F140337&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F4%2F22961325%2Fifixit-galaxy-s22-ultra-teardown-repairability-s-pen-stylus\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy S21</a>. For reference, last year’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPhone%2B13%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F144928&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F4%2F22961325%2Fifixit-galaxy-s22-ultra-teardown-repairability-s-pen-stylus\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 13 Pro</a> scored six out of 10, which proves that it’s possible to do better without sacrificing the premium flagship feel of a device. </p><p id=\"5R7crY\"><em><strong>Correction March 4th, 2PM ET: </strong></em><em>A previous version of this post misspelled the name of Marques Brownlee.
