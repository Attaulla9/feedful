While it isn’t quite as high-end as Apple’s Pro Display XDR, the Studio Display has one big advantage over it: for the $1,599 you’ll pay for the monitor, you’ll also get an included stand.</p><p id=\"XVVLnn\">The lack of a stand was one of the biggest criticisms of Apple’s $4,999 (starting price) 6K Pro Display XDR when it was announced in 2019 — and perhaps more outrageous was that Apple’s official stand accessory cost an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/3/18651001/apples-mac-pro-xdr-display-monitor-stand-expensive-dongle-not-included-wwdc-2019\">eye-watering $999</a>. Fortunately, Apple isn’t forcing you to pay that kind of premium to be able to stand the Studio Display on your desk.</p><p id=\"zZprZ6\">That said, the base-level stand with the Studio Display only lets you tilt its angle. If you want to be able to change its height, you will need to pony up $400 more for Apple’s height-adjustable stand or pick the $1,599 option that comes with a VESA mount adapter to connect to a stand you already have.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHrOEG4mPWgaOa4R2b10V8yTWDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298790/Screen_Shot_2022_03_08_at_11.15.33_AM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Here are the stand options available if you order a Studio Display.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"qusmEu\">And it’s also worth pointing out that $400 is a huge premium for a metal stand. With that amount of money, you can buy an entire 4K monitor. Though the huge surcharge perhaps shouldn’t be a surprise — Apple is the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222310/apple-mac-pro-feet-wheels-kits-stainless-steel-price-delivery\">that sells a $699 wheels kit for the Mac Pro</a>, after all.</p><p id=\"nd42wV\">Apple’s Studio Display is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-studio-display/standard-glass-tilt-adjustable-stand\">now available to order on Apple’s website</a>. </p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"HiHK2C\"><h2 id=\"3gPoMz\">Related:</h2><div id=\"h9mKIB\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Apple March 2022|106185\" data-volume-uuid=\"d46b6b1e2\" data-volume-id=\"106185\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-914\" class=\"volume-video\"></div></div>",
