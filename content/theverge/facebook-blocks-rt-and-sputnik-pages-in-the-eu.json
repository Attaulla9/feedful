The change means that the <em>RT</em> and <em>Sputnik</em> pages aren’t visible in the EU on Facebook and Instagram, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone tells <em>The Verge</em>. </p><p id=\"L4GqJN\">“We have received requests from a number of Governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state controlled media,” Nick Clegg, the company’s newly-named <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937673/meta-policy-lead-nick-clegg-promoted-new-title-policy\">president of global affairs</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickclegg/status/1498395147536527360?s=21\">said Monday on Twitter</a>. “Given the exceptional nature of the current situation, we will be restricting access to RT and Sputnik across the EU at this time.”</p><div id=\"yDHCGQ\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We have received requests from a number of Governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state controlled media.

On Sunday, Clegg said the company had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/27/22953790/facebook-restricts-access-russian-state-controlled-media-ukraine\">limited access</a> to “several accounts” in Ukraine, “including those belonging to some Russian state media organizations.” The action announced Monday goes wider by limiting access to two major outlets across all of the EU.</p><p id=\"4bedKd\">The company has also blocked <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22952038/facebook-russian-state-media-blocked-advertising-monetization-ukraine-conflict\">Russian state media from advertising on the platform</a> and removed a Russian misinformation network <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954451/facebook-twitter-remove-misinformation-network-russian-propaganda-ukraine-invasion\">distributing fake news about the invasion</a>. However, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950874/russia-facebook-blocked-roskomnadzor-media-censorship\">Russia has partially blocked access to Facebook</a>, and Clegg said Sunday that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickclegg/status/1498014385121415179\">Russia has been “throttling” its platform</a>. Russia has also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22952006/russia-block-twitter-ukraine-invasion-censorship-putin\">blocked access to Twitter</a>. </p>",
