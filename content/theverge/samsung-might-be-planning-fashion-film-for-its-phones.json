The UK Intellectual Property Office application describes “protective and decorative films adapted for smartphones,” using the name “Fashion Film.” </p><p id=\"lMt1ZP\">This doesn’t confirm that an actual product will follow (you can see <a href=\"https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmowner/page/search?id=98843&amp;domain=1&amp;app=0&amp;mark=UK00003762790\">other trademarks Samsung’s registered</a> to find out how many are never used). Still, any sign the company is taking a step to enter the skin accessory market is notable. Currently, the space is mainly taken over by smaller companies like Dbrand, which has even had its product featured in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlConrad/status/1225458132786253824\">Samsung’s stores</a>. And while the trademark application doesn’t specify a particular phone these skins would be compatible with; they may just be cool alternatives for anyone who wants to opt out of using a phone case for easily-changeable looks. </p><p id=\"5Jint8\">Samsung <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22735494/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-bespoke-edition-design-unpacked-2\">announced Bespoke Edition</a> smartphones for its Galaxy Z Flip 3 in October that’ll also allow owners to change out their phone’s color using a small lineup of color choices for $79. Dieter Bohn argued that Samsung’s promotion of the Galaxy Z Flip 3 as a stylish choice, instead of emphasizing powerful specs, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22652375/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-phones-fashion\">represented a change in what the devices can communicate about their owners,</a> and selling swappable skins would be another acknowledgment of that. </p><p id=\"oRTun3\">In response to a request for comment on this news, Dbrand CEO Adam Ijaz told <em>The Verge,</em> “lmao ‘fashion film’.” </p>",
