The <em>Diablo</em>-like MMO launched yesterday in the West, after Amazon Games collaborated with Smilegate RPG to localize and translate <em>Lost Ark</em> and make it available in English. It has now passed concurrent records for both <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> and <em>Dota 2, </em>which regularly dominate the top of Steam’s most-played games.</p><p id=\"eLdBnB\"><em>Lost Ark</em> is so popular right now that it has experienced server issues and there’s a queue just to start playing. <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/graph/?sort=peak\">SteamDB lists</a> concurrent players of <em>Lost Ark</em> at 1,311,842, passing <em>CS:GO</em>’s record of 1,308,963 players and <em>Dota 2</em>’s of 1,295,114. It’s not clear exactly how many of those players are actually actively playing the game and not sitting in a server queue, though.</p><p id=\"IwP3Ew\">Either way, it’s now second place on the top concurrent list behind only <em>PUGB</em>. It still has a long way to go to beat <em>PUBG</em>’s all-time peak of 3,257,248 players. <em>Lost Ark</em> is a second huge hit for Amazon Games, after <em>New World </em>set a concurrent record of 913,634 players four months ago. </p><p id=\"gtpJTy\"><em>Lost Ark</em> was originally released in 2019 in South Korea, and has millions of active players in South Korea, Russia, and Japan. It’s free-to-play and has also quickly risen to the top of Twitch, overtaking the popular Just Chatting category.</p>",
