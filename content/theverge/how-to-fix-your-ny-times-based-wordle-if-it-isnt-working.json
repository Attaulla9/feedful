But I understood why the <em>Times</em> would want it, and why the game’s creator would want to not have to deal with its unexpected popularity. So I heaved a sigh, and prepared to continue to play on the new site.</p><p id=\"vd8GEe\">The day came: I clicked on the familiar <em>powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle</em> URL and saw <em>www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html </em>in the address field. I mentally shrugged, and prepared for my morning battle with the English language.</p><p id=\"W95BoG\">And — nothing.</p><p id=\"n5HdFS\">A blank screen. No 404 notice, no “your internet connection is loused up” message — and especially, no Wordle. Just a blank screen.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Where’s my Wordle?\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rSk1nnJsxh9dDWrIYnSRH8lLrjo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23249442/Screen_Shot_2022_02_16_at_9.10.06_AM__1_.png\">      <figcaption><em>Where’s my Wordle?</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"DUbxHW\">Frustrated, but unwilling to spend too much time trying to figure it out, I got rid of the tab and tried again. No luck. </p><p id=\"ZNLKmW\">Was Wordle somehow down? No — I was able to access it on my Pixel 6 phone, on an incognito browser, and on Safari (which I hardly ever use). And nobody else here at <em>The Verge</em> seemed to be complaining. So I put it down to a glitch, and played on my phone instead.</p><p id=\"LH5uvG\">But for the next couple of days, the same thing kept happening. It was as though the fates — or maybe <em>The Verge</em>’s IT department — had decreed that I should not be playing word games on my work computer. But this computer was where my previous Wordle statistics, as pitiful as they were, were kept. I was in despair.</p><p id=\"C0UvlF\">Until I finally rose from my despondency, took a deep breath, and started searching for a solution. And finally <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wordle/comments/sqqkr7/wordle_glitch_is_only_giving_me_a_blank/\">found it in Reddit</a>. </p><div id=\"nmj9qG\">    <blockquote class=\"reddit-card\" data-card-created='\"2022-02-16T14:48:50.224731+00:00\"'>      <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wordle/comments/sqqkr7/wordle_glitch_is_only_giving_me_a_blank/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share\">wordle glitch is only giving me a blank unresponsive screen on Firefox</a> from      <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wordle/\">wordle</a>    </blockquote>    <script async=\"\" src=\"https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script></div><p id=\"ntCjb7\">It turned out I wasn’t the only one. There were others who were finding that they suddenly could not access their morning Wordle fix. The problem?</p><p id=\"a8wNQ9\">They were <em>New York Times</em> subscribers.</p><p id=\"hn1qNX\">It turns out that, for at least a few of us who actually subscribe to the <em>Times</em>, Wordle has an issue with the cookies that the newspaper leaves on our browser. (And it’s not just Chrome — there were complaints from people using Firefox and Safari.) The solution was to get rid of all the cookies the <em>Times</em> left on your browser. </p><p id=\"aPNSF8\">In case you’ve also been experiencing this frustrating problem, here’s how to do that in Chrome. (If you use a different browser, you should be able to find the solution by doing a quick search.) </p><ul><li id=\"YHuLVs\">Click on the three dots in the upper right corner</li><li id=\"eQ41Pz\">Go to Settings &gt; Security and Privacy &gt; Cookies and other site data &gt; See all cookies and site data</li><li id=\"QxNRkV\">In the upper right will be a search field. Type in “nytimes”</li><li id=\"xipg7d\">Click on “Remove All Shown”</li></ul><p id=\"PoWS6R\">That should do it. It did it for me — after that, I went to the powerlanguage URL, clicked it, and found myself at my familiar Wordle site (albeit with the new NY Times address), along with my stats.</p><p id=\"8q2XJ3\">And once again, I can start my mornings enjoying coffee, toast, and Wordle. Well, sort of enjoying — I haven’t been able to solve the game in less than four lines for about a week now...</p>",
