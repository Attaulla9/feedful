A Friday evening report from the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-draws-interest-from-potential-suitors-including-amazon-11644012693\"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> tosses out Amazon as one of the “potential suitors” that may be considering a deal — just as markets closed for the weekend and only a few days before Peloton issues its Q2 2022 earnings report <a href=\"https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-reports-preliminary-second-quarter\">on February 8th</a>. Just the suggestion caused a spike in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%24pton\">Peloton’s stock price</a>, sending it up 20–30 percent in after-hours trading.</p><div><div id=\"HemkuH\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:11013376\"></div></div></div><p id=\"htwh4K\">Peloton’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22778851/peloton-growing-pains-connected-fitness-tonal-hydrow-mirror\">yo-yoing fortunes over the last two years have been well documented</a>, but combine the deep-pocketed tech giants trying to enhance their health and fitness portfolios and the reality of re-opening gyms, there are some dots to connect. Over the last few weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-apple-will-buy-peloton\">some reports</a> have suggested Apple as a possible landing spot, but that seems unlikely. Apple’s health approach uses the Watch first, then connects services to any fitness equipment its customers prefer to use, not high-priced workout-specific hardware that can be replaced by a cheaper bike and BYO tablet.</p><p id=\"5Ydy4M\">Amazon makes a little more sense as a destination, even if it’s only a little more. There was an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452145/amazon-prime-bike-500-disavow-echelon-fitness-peleton-competitor\">almost-launch of a Peloton-like “Prime Bike” in 2020</a> that I still can’t figure out, plus two attempts at fitness-tracking wristwear of its own with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep\">Halo Band in 2020</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22834452/amazon-halo-view-review-fitness-trackers\">Halo View</a> in December. Shelling out double-digit billions — a purchase could cost something near the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/16/15816174/amazon-whole-foods-acquisition-supermarket-stores\">$13.7 billion Amazon spent to acquire Whole Foods</a> — on Peloton would be an expensive but effective way to catch up with the fitness/health sector competition.</p><p id=\"2ChJUw\">According to the <em>WSJ</em>, Amazon is working with advisors to consider its next move. Whether an acquisition attempt comes from the company or anyone else is still up in the air. Also muddying the situation, according to the paper, is that CEO John Foley and other insiders control 80 percent of Peloton’s voting shares, so activist investor calls for a sale may not carry much weight. Either way, we’ll probably have a better idea of the company’s future by the time its earnings report hits on Tuesday afternoon.</p><aside id=\"uPUjVV\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Peloton’s woes continue as it temporarily halts bike, treadmill production \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893462/peloton-bikes-treadmills-production-connected-fitness\"},{\"title\":\"Peloton scrubs viral ads starring Chris Noth after the Mr. Big actor is accused of sexual assault \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841034/peloton-viral-ads-sex-and-the-city-mr-big-chris-noth-sexual-assault\"},{\"title\":\"Amazon announces new wearable and services to try to make you fitter \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692305/amazon-halo-view-fitness-tracker-nutrition-membership-screen\"},{\"title\":\"Peloton’s latest gadget is a $90 heart rate monitor for your arm \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22906352/peloton-heart-rate-band-fitness-tracking\"}]}'></div></aside>",
