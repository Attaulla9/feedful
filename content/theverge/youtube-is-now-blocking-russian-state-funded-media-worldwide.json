The Russian government has responded to tech companies’ policies by blocking or limiting access to sites like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22960739/russia-internet-block-facebook-meta-roskomnadzor-ukraine\">Facebook</a> or Twitter. Today, it announced that it will be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22972869/instagram-ban-russia-ukraine-facebook-whatsapp-meta\">banning Instagram in the country</a> starting March 14th.</p><p id=\"pASgGs\">While not being able to access content from channels like RT and Sputnik worldwide is an escalation from YouTube, Google had already made it so the channels couldn’t monetize their videos. In late February, the company said that Russian state media outlets <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22952439/youtube-bans-ads-rt-russia-channels-google-ukraine\">wouldn’t be allowed to run ads on their videos</a>. Last week, Google went one step further by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22961302/google-pauses-all-ad-sales-russia-search-youtube\">pausing all ad sales in Russia</a>.</p>",
