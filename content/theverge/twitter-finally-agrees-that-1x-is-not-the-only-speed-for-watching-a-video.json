Based on Twitter’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1491181618224062474\">announcement tweet</a>, it looks like you can watch a video at as slow as 0.25x speed or as fast as 2x. </p><div id=\"rBv1K6\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In 2x, 1x, 0.5x…now testing more options in playback speed for videos.<br><br>Some of you on Android and web will have different sets of playback speeds to choose from so you can slow down or speed up videos and voice Tweets. <a href=\"https://t.co/OfGPf4F6Og\">pic.twitter.com/OfGPf4F6Og</a></p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1491181618224062474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"cUbKnE\">According to Twitter spokesperson Joseph Nuñez, users will be able to pick your playback speed on “Tweet Videos, Amplify Videos, Voice Tweets, videos in DMs, and Video Live Replays, depending on their platform.” Nuñez also said that Twitter plans to expand the test to iOS in the future.</p><p id=\"z7vyHh\">Unfortunately for me, I might have to wait just a bit longer to try the feature out. I don’t appear to have access to the test yet on the web, and I can’t access it on mobile since I have an iPhone, so it seems I’ll be stuck in 1x hell for the foreseeable future. </p><p id=\"icyJG5\"><em><strong>Update February 8th, 7:19PM ET</strong></em><em>: Added statement from Twitter.</em></p>",
