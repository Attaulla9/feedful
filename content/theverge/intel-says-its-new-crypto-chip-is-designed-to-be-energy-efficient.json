The company is focusing on sustainability, and plans on “developing the most energy-efficient computing technologies at scale.”</p><p id=\"0rL2Mh\">Intel’s first crypto-focused chip, which it calls a “blockchain accelerator” is set to ship later this year. Two companies have already preordered the technology, including Bitcoin mining company GRIID Infrastructures and Block, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807578/jack-dorsey-rumor-resign-twitter-ceo-square-web3\">Jack Dorsey</a>-owned fintech company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812752/square-changing-name-block-jack-dorsey-cash-app-tidal-crypto-spiral\">formerly known as Square</a>.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"H6UMMH\"><q>The environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining has become a huge concern</q></aside></div><p id=\"tIJZMj\">“We expect that our circuit innovations will deliver a blockchain accelerator that has over 1000x better performance per watt than mainstream GPUs for SHA-256 based mining,” Raja Koduri, Intel’s senior vice president explains in the announcement, referring to the SHA-256 hashing algorithm used to generate Bitcoin and a number of other cryptocurrencies.</p><p id=\"kT4KZP\">Intel says more information about the chip will become available at the <a href=\"https://www.isscc.org/\">International Solid-State Circuits Conference</a>, which starts on February 20th. As <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/intel-to-enter-bitcoin-mining-market-with-energy-efficient-gpu\"><em>PCMag</em></a> points out, the company is scheduled to make a presentation (<a href=\"https://submissions.mirasmart.com/ISSCC2022/PDF/ISSCC2022AdvanceProgram.pdf\">PDF</a>) at the ISCC on February 23rd, titled “Bonanza Mine: An Ultra-Low-Voltage Energy-Efficient Bitcoin Mining ASIC.” ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuits, is a chip designed for one specific task, such as cryptocurrency mining.</p><p id=\"SHcO1y\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/4/20682109/bitcoin-energy-consumption-annual-calculation-cambridge-index-cbeci-country-comparison\">environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining</a> has become a huge concern, and Intel’s new chip may be an attempt to address that. Power-hungry mining rigs often <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702543/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-emissions-china\">get their energy from coal and natural gas plants</a> that can harm the environment, and can also contribute to high electricity costs and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/27/22805033/kazakhstan-cryptocurrency-miners-suffer-energy-shortages\">blackouts</a>. US lawmakers have even brought up the issue in Congress, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893720/us-congress-hearing-cryptocurrency-energy-bitcoin-mining\">debating how to tackle the rising energy consumption</a> associated with mining crypto, and even asking Bitcoin companies to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22906334/us-lawmakers-letter-cryptocurrency-mining-bitcoin-energy\">disclose how much energy they consume</a>.</p>",
