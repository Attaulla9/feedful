It also rolled out <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/196419427651178\">a “one-click tool” in Ukraine</a> that lets users lock their profiles, preventing anyone but friends from viewing their posts, photos, and Stories — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634209/facebook-hides-friends-lists-instagram-safety-afghanistan-taliban-security\">Facebook launched the same feature</a> during the crisis in Afghanistan last August.</p><p id=\"zgdVxV\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950874/russia-facebook-blocked-roskomnadzor-media-censorship\">Russia already partially blocked access to Facebook in the country</a>, with the Russian government claiming the platform “restricted” four accounts associated with Russian media outlets. The country’s tech and communications regulator ordered the social network to stop fact-checking and labeling content from state-owned media, but Facebook refused to comply.</p><p id=\"TxqYBZ\">“We are closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine and will keep sharing steps we’re taking to protect people on our platform,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ngleicher/status/1497417243436589057\">Gleicher added</a>.</p><p id=\"JeV4cC\"></p>",
