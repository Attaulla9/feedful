Ukraine’s vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1500022660952203266\">tweeted out</a> a letter from PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, confirming the company’s decision to shut down its operations in Russia.</p><div id=\"fHTNeH\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We received a letter from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dan_Schulman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Dan_Schulman</a>, CEO PayPal.
