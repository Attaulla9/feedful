It’s a notable milestone as Epic continues to build the Epic Games Store as a competitor to Steam and bring in new players for titles like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket League. </em>Epic didn’t share further details about that 500 million, however, so it’s unclear how many of those accounts represent segments like people that only play Epic’s own games (such as <em>Fortnite</em>) or those who have only used Epic’s store. </p><p id=\"RAJbVF\">The company has put a huge amount of resources behind growing its PC games store — and therefore, getting more people to sign up for accounts — since it launched in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/4/18124203/epic-games-fortnite-valve-steam-game-store-distribution-unreal-engine\">December 2018</a>. One document from the <em>Epic v. Apple</em> trial, for example, showed that Epic had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380895/epic-games-store-afford-give-away-17-5-billion-free-games\">$330 million in unrecouped costs</a> <em>in 2020 alone</em> from paying developers to give away their games on its store. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs\">Another document showed</a> that more than 7 million people tried the Epic Games Store because of its <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> giveaway — despite the 8-hour outage that happened because of the freebie. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22903505/epic-games-store-free-2022\">Epic has committed to giving away free games again in 2022</a>, so it seems that the company continues to think the cost is worth it to bring in users. </p><p id=\"Gd26wi\">Epic is also seeing a lot of use of its Unreal Engine developer tools; the company announced that 48 percent of “announced next-gen games” are being built on the platform. </p><aside id=\"rJPr3m\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs\"},{\"title\":\"Three reasons why Epic Games can give away $17.5 billion worth of games for free\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380895/epic-games-store-afford-give-away-17-5-billion-free-games\"}]}'></div></aside>",
