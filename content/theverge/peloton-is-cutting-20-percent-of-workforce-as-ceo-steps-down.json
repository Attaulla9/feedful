The job cuts amount to around 20 percent of the former pandemic darling’s corporate workforce, but will not affect the company’s lauded roster of instructors or fitness content.</p><p id=\"8IYmDG\">Peloton hopes the changes will boost profitability after waning demand for its connected fitness equipment have made it an acquisition target, with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22918596/peloton-amazon-acquisition-rumor-fitness-bike-wearables\">Amazon</a>, Nike, and even Apple named as possible suitors.
