In a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-on-subaru-sti-301500419.html\">press release</a> shared by the automaker on Friday, Subaru says it has no plans to build a gas-powered STI based on this generation’s WRX platform.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"eKznc8\"><q>“Subaru Corporation is exploring opportunities for the next generation Subaru WRX STI, including electrification”</q></aside></div><p id=\"F9iHhf\">“Subaru Corporation is exploring opportunities for the next generation Subaru WRX STI, including electrification,” the company writes. “In the meantime, a next generation internal combustion engine WRX STI will not be produced based upon the new WRX platform.”</p><p id=\"4Aaza8\">Subaru cites its efforts to meet the “regulations and requirements for greenhouse gasses (GHG), zero emissions vehicles (ZEV), and Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÉ)” as the reason behind the change.</p><p id=\"p5Cyh5\">The STI is Subaru’s flagship performance vehicle and is typically released with its WRX lineup. While the STI may make a return eventually, it could trade its exhaust pipe for a battery pack.
