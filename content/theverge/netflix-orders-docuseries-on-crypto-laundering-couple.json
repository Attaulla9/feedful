The couple allegedly attempted to launder the stolen funds through a “labyrinth” of cryptocurrency transactions that included buying gold and NFTs. At the time, the stolen assets were valued at about $71 million — that number has since ballooned to $4.5 billion, making the DOJ’s $3.6 billion recovery the “largest financial seizure ever.”</p>",
