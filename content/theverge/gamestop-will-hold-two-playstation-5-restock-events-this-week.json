Thankfully, we’re happy to report that GameStop is scheduled to restock the PlayStation 5 twice this week. The retailer will have the PS5 Digital Edition available for sale on its site beginning today, March 8th, at 11AM EST / 8AM PST. This is a rare drop just for the entry-level model of the PS5, which lacks the disc drive. But if you are hoping to snag the standard, disc-equipped PS5, there’s more hope for you later this week. Select GameStop stores will have the standard model on Friday, March 11th, for in-person sales.</p><p id=\"OLALkg\">Both of these PS5 restocks will be in bundle form, which is typical of GameStop. They also are exclusive to <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=vergegamestops5restock&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop’s Power Rewards Pro members</a>, a paid membership that runs $14.99 a year.

Altogether, that bundle will run a hefty price around $797 — a far cry from the console’s $499 value when sold on its own, but at least these are some of the latest games and accessories you may want.</p><p id=\"vspMQ2\">This is shaping up to be one of the most extensive PS5 restocks from GameStop in quite some time, but availability will likely be very limited. When it comes to ordering a Digital Edition bundle from GameStop’s site, be sure to sign in with your Pro account ahead of time and pre-fill all your shipping and billing info. We’ll update this post with more details and links to GameStop’s listings once we have them.
