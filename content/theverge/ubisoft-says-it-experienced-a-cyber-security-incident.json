Ubisoft said it believes that “at this time there is no evidence any player personal information was accessed or exposed as a by-product of this incident” and says that games and services are now “functioning normally.” Out of caution, the company also “initiated a company-wide password reset.” When asked for comment, Ubisoft spokesperson Jessica Roache said the company had no additional details to share.</p><p id=\"VPFy2J\">News of the incident arrives amid a recent wave of high-profile hacks. Nvidia confirmed on March 1st that it was hacked and <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-confirms-company-data-was-stolen-in-hack\">said that</a> the hackers are leaking employee credentials and proprietary information. Samsung said on March 7th that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/7/22965220/samsung-hack-lapsus-galaxy-source-code-confirmed-nvidia\">hackers stole</a> internal company data and source code for Galaxy devices. The LAPSUS$ hacking group has taken responsibility for those two breaches. It’s unclear if the group was involved in any way with the Ubisoft security incident.</p><p id=\"NJQ64p\"><em><strong>Update March 11th, 1:01PM ET</strong></em><em>: Added response from Ubisoft.</em></p>",
