Below, we’ve rounded up some of the highlights, whether you’re a fan of tried-and-true platformers or co-op games that are bound to test your friendships. </p><div id=\"HdGGUB\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9514828\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"layout\":\"full_layout\"}'></div></div><div id=\"DbKVkU\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10468219\"></div></div><div id=\"WDV4CR\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10999792\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"layout\":\"full_with_square_img\"}'></div></div><div id=\"GgFY7e\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11087479\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"layout\":\"full_layout\"}'></div></div><div id=\"sbAbgx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10999826\"></div></div><div id=\"spBfMg\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11082030\"></div></div><div id=\"QfZFVE\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9514842\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"layout\":\"full_layout\"}'></div></div><div id=\"6uXlx5\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11087883\"></div></div><p id=\"gmonrg\">Games for the Nintendo Switch are clearly the highlights of today's sale, but you can find plenty of deals on various accessories, too.
