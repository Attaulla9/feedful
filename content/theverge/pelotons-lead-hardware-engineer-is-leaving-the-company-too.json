Foley is moving into the role of executive chairman of Peloton. At the same time the company announced it would lay off about 2,800 employees, or around 20 percent of its workforce (along with the odd detail that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923480/peloton-severance-package-membership-layoffs\">their severance packages include a one-year Peloton subscription</a>). </p><p id=\"Qu4uGM\">If you want a better idea of what has gone wrong with Peloton so far <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923434/peloton-foley-ceo-layoffs-earnings-connected-fitness\">then we can get you caught up on the story here</a>, and even explain why a rumored acquisition might not be the next step.</p>",
