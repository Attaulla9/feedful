The two firms, Merit Peak Ltd. and Sigma Chain AG, serve as market makers that continually buy and sell crypto on Binance.US, helping to lower price volatility.</p><p id=\"dnbsVr\">The SEC is particularly concerned with the way Binance discloses its ties to the two trading firms, <em>WSJ</em> reports. On the Binance.US website, the crypto exchange tells users that affiliated market makers can trade on the platform. However, it doesn’t name specific firms.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"i27HP8\"><q>The SEC has asked Binance.US for more information about both firms</q></aside></div><p id=\"DLbdI2\">The SEC has asked Binance.US for more information about both companies. According to the <em>WSJ</em>, corporate documents from 2019 indicate a link between Zhao and the two firms. Former executives also reportedly say Zhao started controlling both companies last year.</p><p id=\"pPw08o\"><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/23/crypto-exchange-giant-binance-to-launch-us-trading-tuesday/\">Binance created its separate Binance.US arm</a> in 2019 to comply with US regulations. The Internal Revenue Service and Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434965/binance-investigation-irs-justice-cryptocurrency\">opened an investigation into the Cayman Islands-based company</a> last year, with officials specializing in money laundering and tax offenses looking into the case. Last September, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-17/u-s-s-binance-probe-expands-to-examine-possible-insider-trading\">the investigations expanded to include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a> to probe potential insider trading and market manipulation. Investigations are still ongoing.</p>",
