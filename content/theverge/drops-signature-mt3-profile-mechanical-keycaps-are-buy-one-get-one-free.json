Drop has a very special sale on its exclusive collection of MT3 profile keycaps for Cherry-style mechanical keyboards. You can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fall-communities%2Fdrops%2FMT3BOGO&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F19%2F22941208%2Fdrop-mt3-mechanical-keyboard-keycaps-apple-macbook-pro-xbox-stereo-headset-elite-logitech-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">buy two base or ortholinear sets of keycaps and get them for the price of one</a> when you use code <strong>MT3FREE</strong> until Sunday, February 20th. That may sound like a jumble of confusing jargon for the mechanical keyboard uninitiated, but that’s ok, because we’re here to help people learn as well as save. </p><p id=\"ZRbaHJ\">Drop’s signature MT3 keycaps have a deeply scalloped contour for your fingers to gently rest in as you type. They fit most Cherry MX keyboard switches — the most commonly used type out there — and they’re made of high quality ABS or PBT plastics. They’re <a href=\"https://matt3o.com/about-mt3-profile-and-devtty-set/\">designed by Matt3o</a>, and come in all kinds of funky colorways, ranging from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fdrop-mt3-jukebox-keycap-set%3FdefaultSelectionIds%3D939725&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F19%2F22941208%2Fdrop-mt3-mechanical-keyboard-keycaps-apple-macbook-pro-xbox-stereo-headset-elite-logitech-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a touch of retro</a> to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fdrop-mito-mt3-cyber-custom-keycap-set%3FdefaultSelectionIds%3D962931&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F19%2F22941208%2Fdrop-mt3-mechanical-keyboard-keycaps-apple-macbook-pro-xbox-stereo-headset-elite-logitech-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">futuristic</a>. This deal is exclusively on the base kits (the QWERTY layouts you’re used to seeing) and ortholinear kits (highly specialized boards with keys arranged in an even grid), with prices ranging from $110 to $130 per set.</p><p id=\"pEJ5gh\">Since Drop has the exclusive rights to the MT3 tooling, there are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22905351/mechanical-keyboard-keycap-clones-imitators-knockoffs-olivia-biip\">no knockoffs or counterfeits out there to rip these off</a>, but they’re also much easier to come by compared to keycaps sold in group-buys that can take months to deliver. Some of these MT3 keycaps have already sold out at Drop, but if you hurry you can still snag a pair of cool sets with this offer and essentially save 50 percent.</p><div id=\"jl8MMm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11057440\"></div></div><p id=\"2KeQKE\">Now for a deal that isn’t just for us keyboard fanatics. Apple’s latest 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has been a bonafide hit with content creators and power users alike, is now available for $2,299 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQKBQSB/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgETPchPqMn\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>. That’s $200 off the supersized, base-level model, which comes equipped with the M1 Pro 10-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of SSD storage. The larger MacBook Pro is ideal for photo and video editing given its excellent display and blazing-fast performance, especially when using native Apple apps like Final Cut X. The screen may have a polarizing notch at the top of it, but with terrific hardware under the hood and a wealth of convenient ports, it’s easier to overlook. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><aside id=\"zMri1h\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple’s notch ‘fix’ brings fat bezels back to the MacBook Pro\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750236/apple-macbook-pro-hide-notch-fix-scale-to-fit\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"WKfrNM\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10814228\"></div></div><p id=\"ppj1wp\">On the topic of speed and performance, Samsung’s 1TB PCIe 4.0-ready 980 Pro is currently on sale for $169.99, complete with a heatsink, at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgEWPTuIuUs\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHL33X7?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. This M.2 SSD is fast enough for a serious PC or even the PlayStation 5, and right now it’s $80 off its regular price of $249.99. If you don’t need the heatsink — a requirement for the PS5 — the price is even lower at Amazon, where you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pick it up right now for $149.99</a>, its second-best price to date.

This lightweight mouse was developed with esports in mind, but you’d never guess it just by looking at its svelte, true ambidextrous design. That’s because it can easily blend in with just about any desk setup without being overbearing or garish, something that is a common occurrence with many gaming-focused peripherals.</p><p id=\"lmxagg\">There is a newer model of this mouse — the Logitech G Pro X Superlight, which is currently <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale at Amazon for $149</a> — but it costs nearly double the sale price of the last-gen G Pro.

This headset shares a lot in common with the pricier Xbox Wireless Headset — it’s just wired with a 3.5mm cable. That same wire makes it compatible with just about anything that uses a headphone jack, including non-Xbox consoles like the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. We see these drop in price once in a while, and they’re worth a look if you want a no-frills gaming headset that nails the essentials. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22933892/microsoft-xbox-stereo-headset-review-gaming-headphones\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><aside id=\"DoSk6m\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"W62ELB\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10860198\"></div></div><p id=\"cpALJG\">The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, another gaming favorite of ours, has returned to an all-time low of $139.99 ($40 off) at <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=vergedailydeals021922&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fxbox-one%2Fproducts%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-elite-black-series-2-wireless-controller%2F202695.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals021922\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>. The excellence of the Elite Series 2 comes from its myriad customization options, which lets you fine-tune how the controller feels with a swappable D-pad and thumbsticks. Its optional rear paddle buttons are also mappable to whatever function you please, allowing you to have the edge in first-person shooters and other games where it's essential to keep both thumbs on the sticks at all times. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"Hqpw6j\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10763457\"></div></div><h2 id=\"nPnWim\">Some more deals to not snooze at</h2><ul><li id=\"mA6RO9\">One of Intel’s 12th Gen Core i7 desktop CPUs is discounted at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/deal/97710220?ref=dlx_deals_gd_dcl_img_36_97710220_dt_sl15_53\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> right now.
