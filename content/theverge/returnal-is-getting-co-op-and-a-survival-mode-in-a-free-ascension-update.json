A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746400/returnal-ps5-housemarque-suspend-feature-photo-mode-update\">previous 2.0 update</a> from last year focused instead of adding major quality of life additions, like the much-requested ability to suspend a run without losing your progress and a photo mode. </p><aside id=\"38LGNY\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Returnal finally adds a ‘suspend’ feature to let you pause the game mid-run\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746400/returnal-ps5-housemarque-suspend-feature-photo-mode-update\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"W8Tc7y\">Co-op mode is online only, with no split-screen option available, which means that you’ll need internet and a PlayStation Plus subscription to team up with a friend to try and survive the murderous mysteries of Atropos. Players also won’t be able to play cooperatively in the new Tower of Sisyphus area, the game’s first-person “House” sequences, and in challenge mode.  </p><p id=\"niW5k3\">The Tower of Sisyphus, meanwhile, will offer players a series of 20 floors of increasingly difficultly that they’ll be able to battle their way through — presumably, with some new mysteries to uncover along the way. </p>",
