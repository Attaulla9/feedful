The Mac Studio features both Apple’s M1 Max chip and a new, even more powerful processor, the<em> </em>M1 Ultra. It looks a bit similar to the Mac Mini, but Apple claims that the new device will be faster than even its top-of-the-line Mac Pro.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The Mac Studio on a white background.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lcnr_w8pMfaAImuPZFZXo8iAMX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298707/lcimg_fdf22f4d_15be_4f9d_a0d2_9f15780b1ae1.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Apple</cite>      <figcaption><em>Not as huge as the Mac Pro.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"e6HspP\">The chassis is 3.7 inches tall; Apple claims it “fits perfectly under most displays” and will remain quiet under heavy workloads. The rear includes four Thunderbolt 4 ports as well as a 10Gb Ethernet port, two USB-A ports, an HDMI, and an audio jack. It supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0. The front includes two USB-C ports (10 Gbps on M1 Max systems, 40 Gbps/Thunderbolt 4 on M1 Ultra systems) and an SD card slot. The Mac Studio can support up to four Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV, Apple says.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"A user works on the Mac Studio and Mac Studio Display.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7A4qqkYapkXHne9nDQo1-LLI3Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298840/Apple_Mac_Studio_Studio_Display_lifestyle_01_220308.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Apple</cite>      <figcaption><em>This could be you, for $1,999.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"DfTLMU\">Apple claims that the Mac Studio with M1 Max will deliver 50 percent faster CPU performance than a Mac Pro with a 16-core Xeon and 2.5 times faster CPU performance than a 27-inch iMac with a 10-core Core i9. The M1 Ultra configuration purportedly has 3.8 times faster CPU performance than that 27-inch iMac and is up to 90 percent faster than the 16-core Mac Pro.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"A user works on the Mac Studio Display.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EdjMQ3qI2Zhnw1Bur6aVpYG3CJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298812/lcimg_3cf0d7db_821f_4efb_8c69_29cbe61d1f1a.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Apple</cite>      <figcaption><em>That black!</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"JYJIlB\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22958174/apple-silicon-m1-ultra-chip-soc-processor-cpu-gpu-update\">The M1 Ultra</a> is a monstrous chip supporting up to 128GB of memory. It has a 20-core CPU with 16 high-performance cores and four efficiency cores, as well as a 64-core GPU and a 32-core neural engine. Apple says it’s “nearly” eight times faster than the M1, which powers the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review\">latest Mac Mini</a>. </p><p id=\"XTGRXA\">The Studio is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22962052/apple-studio-display-specs-price-release-date\">Apple’s Studio Display</a>, an external monitor that was also unveiled today.

This display provides additional ports on its rear, including three USB-C ports and a Thunderbolt 4. Nano-texture glass is optional, as are various stands and mounting options.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aRb9JScqmmGpgZHXG5kf201l-k8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298813/lcimg_0095b14f_5984_40ea_8eb7_57c3ccbdc151.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Apple</cite>      <figcaption><em>Here, have some odds and ends from Apple’s presentation.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"eFuuuz\">The Mac Studio with M1 Max will start at $1,999, and M1 Ultra models will start at $3,999.
