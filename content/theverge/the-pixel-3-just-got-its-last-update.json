That’s actually one more update than the company promised — official support was <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705\">only guaranteed through October last year</a>. Yet with one last OS update to Android 12 and this final security patch, Google has finally retired the devices.</p><p id=\"Zz3wam\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos\">Pixel 3 marked a high point</a> in the Pixel series’ early evolution. Google righted the wrongs of the Pixel 2’s display problems and continued to impress with its camera capabilities. Funny-looking notch on the XL aside, they were great-looking devices that did their class-leading cameras real justice. </p><aside id=\"RMC9m7\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL review: the best camera gets a better phone\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"zBlpYb\">For a couple of generations after the 3, Google couldn’t quite keep the momentum going, as it missed on important features like battery life and waffled on whether it was making mid-range or flagship phones. Last year’s Pixel 6 took the series firmly into flagship territory <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review\">with excellent hardware</a>, though the software experience <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923777/pixel-6-pro-february-update-wifi-bluetooth-bugs\">has been troubled, to say the least</a>. So if you’re a Pixel 3 owner considering upgrading to the Pixel 6, you might want to hold off just a little longer while Google works out the kinks. </p>",
