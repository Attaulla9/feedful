Instead, it apparently infects your system and causes a host of other unusual behavior, like high CPU usage, checking for system drives and other things that should — and did — raise some red flags. The publication points readers to <a href=\"https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/577501/0/executive\">Joe’s SandBox Cloud</a>, a cool site that illustrates exactly how the malicious file spreads through a system upon installation.</p><div id=\"pGvj8j\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cpnk_ItUiLc?rel=0&amp;start=3297\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"DKbu9Z\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency\">Since Nvidia implemented Lite Hash Rate in graphics cards</a> starting in mid-2021, there has been a huge demand (and a very profitable secondary market) for earlier RTX cards that don’t have a hash rate limitation. A tool that could lessen the demand by removing the limit from newer cards is a tempting proposition. Alas, file this one under “if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”</p>",
