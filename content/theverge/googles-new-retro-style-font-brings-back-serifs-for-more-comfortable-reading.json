Serif fonts are also considered to be easier to read, thanks to the more distinct letter shapes, something that Google’s new font expands on by virtue of being a variable font that can automatically change and optimize the letterforms for different size displays. </p><p id=\"jzlBDb\">Google has been using its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/9/2550777/matias-duarte-details-androids-roboto-on-google\">Roboto font</a> in one form or another for over a decade; it was first introduced alongside Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) as the default font for the company’s mobile OS. Roboto has seen plenty of variants over the years, although it’s slowly but steadily been superseded as the company’s primary font by <a href=\"https://material.io/blog/google-material-custom-theme\">Product Sans</a> (and its Google Sans variants, also known as the “Pixel” font) across its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17092800/android-p-new-design-changes-features\">various products</a>. </p><p id=\"SYAMz0\">For now, Roboto Serif is simply being added to Google Fonts as another option for the company’s Roboto family of open-source fonts — but it’s entirely possible that Google may one day use the new, friendly looking font in its own marketing, too. </p>",
