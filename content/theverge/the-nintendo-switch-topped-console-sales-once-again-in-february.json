Last month, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2022/02/11/january-2022-npd-ps5-and-xbox-outsell-nintendo-switch/\">the PS5 took the top spot</a> as the US’s best-selling gaming hardware, while the Switch came in behind the Xbox Series X.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"TYpxo5\"><q>The Switch’s on-and-off-again reign has a lot to do with availability</q></aside></div><p id=\"eMsu7Y\">The Switch and PS5 have been swapping spots as the number one console ever since the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732577/ps5-nintendo-switch-npd-us-sales\">PS5 broke the Switch’s almost three-year streak</a> last October. Its time on top was short-lived, however, as the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review\">new Switch OLED</a> boosted the console’s sales, bringing it back to the number one position through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1470378099028094976\">November</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1483439249810604037\">December</a> 2021. So far in 2022, the Switch has sold the most units, while the PS5 has made the most money.</p><p id=\"8fUleA\">Of course, the Switch’s on-and-off-again reign has a lot to do with availability. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview\">global chip shortage</a> has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel\">made it difficult to find a PS5 and Xbox Series X</a> without paying scalpers’ prices. Meanwhile, the Switch — a now five-year-old console — has become slightly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21257643/nintendo-switch-lite-oled-how-to-buy-in-stock\">easier to find in stores and online</a> despite <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759377/nintendo-making-20-percent-fewer-switches-chip-shortage\">Nintendo cutting its production by 20 percent</a> through March 2022. Whenever availability for the Xbox Series X and PS5 improves, it’ll be interesting to see how the Switch’s sales stack up.</p><p id=\"18RwH2\">As for the best-selling game, <a href=\"http://vhttps://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc\"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> took the top slot (if you couldn’t have guessed). What makes this win all the more impressive, though, is that <em>Elden Ring</em> had only been out for four days in the month of February, and its sales still managed to top the newly-released <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22929852/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-review\"><em>Horizon II: Forbidden West</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch\"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a>.</p>",
