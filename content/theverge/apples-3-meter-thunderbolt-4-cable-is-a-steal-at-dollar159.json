But given the scarcity of other Thunderbolt 4 cable options over 2 meters in length, it might be your only option.</p><p id=\"uvlNFs\">The listing coincides with the announcement of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22962081/apple-mac-studio-m1-max-ultra-price-specs-processor-release-date\">Apple’s new Mac Studio</a>, which includes four Thunderbolt 4 ports on its back to connect to displays and other devices. Apple’s also selling a 1.8-meter cable for $129 that ships in two to three weeks. Apple’s 3-meter Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable says it’s “coming soon.”</p><p id=\"fdZi7v\">Apple’s 3-meter Thunderbolt 4 cable won’t have much, if any, competition when it arrives.

For a very specific kind of user, Apple’s $159 cable might genuinely be the best option.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"XzLf3L\"><q>There’s very little competition</q></aside></div><p id=\"RkWOSh\">Apple’s $129 1.8-meter Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable, meanwhile, is entering into a much more crowded market. Caldigit’s 2-meter alternative <a href=\"http://shop.caldigit.com/us/Adapters%20and%20Cables/Cables?product_id=207\">costs $74.99</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fcables%2Fdata%2Fconnect-thunderbolt-4-cable%2Fp%2Fp-inz002%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F9%2F22968576%2Fapple-3m-thunderbolt-4-cable\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Belkin’s costs $69.99</a>, <a href=\"https://plugable.com/products/tbt4-40g2m\">Plugable has one on sale for $69.95</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cablematters.com/pc-1283-132-40gbps-thunderbolt-4-usb-c-cable-with-100w-charging.aspx\">Cable Matters has one for $59.99</a>. Depending on your needs, you might even be able to save some money with a Thunderbolt 3 cable since the standard <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210205\">supports 5K</a>. Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22962052/apple-studio-display-specs-price-release-date\">5K Studio Monitor</a>, for example, ships with a single Thunderbolt 3 port and a 1-meter Thunderbolt cable in the box.</p><p id=\"mvUU7h\">The Thunderbolt 4 standard is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21317513/intel-thunderbolt-4-standard-docks-cables-usb4-accessories-port-usbc\">less than two years old</a> at this point, so the lack of availability of 3-meter options is likely to abate over time. But if you want to be an early adopter, than it looks like you might have to pay the Apple tax. </p><p id=\"omXI58\"></p><p id=\"rrC8NY\"></p><p id=\"eFJul8\"></p>",
