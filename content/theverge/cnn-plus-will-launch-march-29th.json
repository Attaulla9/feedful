For early subscribers — those who sign up in the first four weeks of its launch— the service will cost $2.99 per month, and they’ll lock in that price for as long as they subscribe. The standard price will be $5.99 per month or $59.99 per year. </p><p id=\"YPWMzX\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583424/cnn-plus-launch-streaming-service-first-quarter\">CNN unveiled plans for its streaming service</a> last July and has announced programming that includes daily versions of weekly CNN shows, all-new shows, and original series and movies. Subscribers will also have access to CNN’s library of content. The company has said it will continue to have a single CNN app, with a section for CNN Plus subscribers to access the streaming content. </p><p id=\"ZXWgTa\">CNN’s parent company WarnerMedia is on the verge of closing a merger with Discovery, and the dust is still settling after the company has had some internal personnel shakeups in recent months. Following the December <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/04/media/cnn-fires-chris-cuomo/index.html\">firing of anchor Chris Cuomo</a>, longtime president <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914592/cnn-jeff-zucker-resigns-romantic-relationship-colleague\">Jeff Zucker resigned in February</a> after failing to properly disclose a relationship with another executive at the company. Chris Licht, an executive at CBS, has been <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/28/cnn-hires-turnaround-expert-chris-licht-to-replace-jeff-zucker.html\">named as Zucker’s replacement</a>. </p><p id=\"DL7TPd\">It’s not clear how or if Zucker’s departure will affect CNN Plus; when the cable company <a href=\"https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2021/07/19/cnn-to-debut-in-q1-2022/\">announced its new streamer</a>, Zucker said it would “offer consumers a streaming product that grows the reach and scope of the CNN brand in a way that no one else is doing. Nothing like this exists.”</p>",
