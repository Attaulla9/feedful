Fans who put down $1,000 to get in line for trucks years before they were built were outraged by the change, which Rivian attributed to inflationary pressure and supply chain problems.</p><p id=\"cJMxCS\">Today, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220303005717/en/A-Letter-from-Rivian-CEO-RJ-Scaringe-on-Pricing-Updates\">wrote customers</a>, admitting that “we wrongly decided to make these changes apply to all future deliveries, including pre-existing configured preorders” and says that instead, Rivian will honor the “original configured price” for all preorders placed prior to March 1st.</p><blockquote><p id=\"8A6gyy\">We failed to appreciate how you viewed your configuration as price locked, and we wrongly assumed the announced Dual-Motor and Standard battery pack would provide configurations that would deliver price points similar to your original configuration. While this was the logic, it was wrong and we broke your trust in Rivian.</p><p id=\"ygrJem\">For anyone with a Rivian preorder as of the March 1 pricing announcement, your original configured price will be honored. If you canceled your preorder on or after March 1 and would like to reinstate it, we will restore your original configuration, pricing and delivery timing. Our team will be sending an email in the next few days with more details.</p></blockquote><p id=\"ygSiAH\"><em>Developing...</em></p>",
