Typically, people with prescription discount cards have to choose between buying a drug out-of-pocket with the discount but not having the cost go towards their deductible or buying a drug through their insurance but without the discount. This program sidesteps that choice.</p><p id=\"FFUrzT\">“They can be free to choose whatever’s cheapest and not have to worry about what applies to their out-of-pocket maximum or the deductible because both apply,” Ayogu <a href=\"https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/amazon-pharmacy-partners-five-blues-plans-offer-prescription-discount-card\">said</a> at the conference.</p><p id=\"rWl5Dt\">MedsYourWay is offered through the pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics, which is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/prime-therapeutics/\">owned by</a> over a dozen Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans. Prime Therapeutics started offering home delivery to some customers through Amazon Pharmacy <a href=\"https://www.primetherapeutics.com/news/prime-therapeutics-taps-amazon-for-home-delivery/\">in fall 2021</a>. </p><p id=\"aq8hPe\">Customers can only use the MedsYourWay card at Amazon Pharmacy. Most prescription discount cards work at a network of pharmacies. </p><p id=\"It92g0\">Amazon launched Amazon Pharmacy <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571091/amazon-pharmacy-store-launch-home-delivery-prescription-medication\">in 2020</a>, two years after acquiring drug delivery startup PillPack. The company continues to expand into healthcare: it has a now-nationwide <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923381/amazon-care-telehealth-nurse-locations\">telehealth program</a> called Amazon Care, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep\">a fitness band</a>, and has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22740181/amazon-alexa-hospitals-senior-living\">integrated Alexa</a> into healthcare settings. </p><p id=\"4Ylus5\"></p>",
