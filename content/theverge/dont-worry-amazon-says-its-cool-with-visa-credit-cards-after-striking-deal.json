In the UK in particular, Visa’s interchange fees on credit cards had <a href=\"https://thepaypers.com/online-payments/visa-raises-interchange-fees-for-uk-based-cardholders%E2%80%941247923\">risen from 0.3 percent to 1.5 percent</a> after the UK left the European Union and was no longer bound by EU fee limits. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"BxNWRM\"><q>“This agreement includes the acceptance of Visa at all Amazon stores and sites today”</q></aside></div><p id=\"b6rDYa\"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that Amazon had considered shifting its lucrative co-branded credit card from Visa to Mastercard to secure better terms. Amazon was reportedly chasing after a similar arrangement to the one struck between Visa and Costco on their co-branded credit card, where Costco was offered a break on all processing fees in exchange for the co-branded partnership.</p><p id=\"OSE1hX\">“We’ve recently reached a global agreement with Visa that allows all customers to continue using their Visa credit cards in our stores,” an Amazon spokesman told <em>Bloomberg. </em>A spokesperson from Visa added that “this agreement includes the acceptance of Visa at all Amazon stores and sites today, as well as a joint commitment to collaboration on new product and technology initiatives.” Both companies <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/17/amazon-and-visa-reach-global-truce-over-credit-card-fees.html\">declined to comment to <em>CNBC</em></a><em> </em>on the exact payment terms of the new agreement. </p><p id=\"oVec1q\">The dispute between the two giants drew widespread attention last November, when Amazon said it would <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786966/amazon-visa-credit-card-ban-alternatives-fees\">no longer be accepting payment via Visa credit cards</a> in the UK after January 19th. However, on January 17th, Amazon said it would continue to accept payment <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/17/22887637/amazon-uk-visa-credit-card-ban-reversed-deal\">via the method after all</a> and that it was “working closely on a potential solution” with Visa.</p>",
