Instead, I found myself exposing a lie. The first real-world 5G test <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/4/18125854/verizon-att-5g-speed-test-slow-maui-qualcomm-snapdragon-summit\">turned out to be a dud</a>, the speeds <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127573/motorola-verizon-5g-speed-test-misleading-maui-snapdragon-tech-summit\">misleading at best</a>, covering up the fact Verizon and AT&amp;T’s millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G wasn’t ready. </p><p id=\"3ei0H5\">For the next three years, Verizon and AT&amp;T successfully employed a fake-it-till-you-make-it strategy, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637213/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte\">enlisting politicians to help them “win” 5G as if it were some kind of “race.”</a> Their fastest 5G networks ran on a chunk of spectrum called millimeter wave that’s speedy but so spotty you’d barely get a signal without a cell tower directly overhead. Meanwhile, powerful phone makers like Apple <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18211044/apple-att-5g-e-network-icon-iphones-misleading-ios-software-update-beta\">were complicit</a> in rebranding LTE networks into things like “5Ge,” helping carriers mislead customers into thinking they’d already rolled out the new networks.</p><p id=\"qdRPZP\">But it now seems the millimeter-wave 5G carriers have been slinging from the start was just a gigantic head fake — a way to stay in the game until their actually useful 5G spectrum was ready. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"7WN7D7\"><q>With the new iPhone SE, Verizon isn’t demanding millimeter wave support</q></aside></div><p id=\"5S7CBW\">On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22959072/iphone-se-3-price-screen-specs-features-release-date-a15-bionic-5g\">Apple announced the 2022 iPhone SE</a>, the first 5G iPhone for the United States that lacks the millimeter-wave 5G that AT&amp;T and <em>especially</em> Verizon have doggedly insisted on for years. Instead of rejecting that iPhone or insisting that Apple make a special version for its millimeter-wave network, Verizon will simply... carry it. Verizon spokesperson George Koroneos confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that the company will stock it in stores. </p><p id=\"2zvKzm\">Why am I making such a big deal about something so normal? You need to understand that things have <em>not been normal</em> in Verizon-land. Verizon pushed Google to create a version of its <em>budget </em>Pixel 4A 5G <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495895/verizon-pixel-4a-5g-uw-exclusive-model-white-price\">that cost $100 more</a> to satisfy the carrier’s ridiculous demand that phones support barely-there millimeter wave. The Verizon version of Samsung’s Galaxy S20 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21286402/samsung-galaxy-s20-5g-uw-mmwave-ram-verizon\">had less RAM and no microSD expansion</a> so they could fit mmWave 5G. All of Apple’s high-end iPhones have had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/13/21515128/iphone-12-mini-pro-max-mmwave-5g-antenna-window\">tiny picture windows for millimeter wave</a> if you buy them in the United States, and for what? Personally, I’ve experienced a Verizon mmWave 5G signal with my iPhone mini a total of <em>once</em>. </p><aside id=\"H6QGv2\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"What’s the difference between 5G, 5G Plus, 5G UW, and 5G UC?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22914668/5g-uw-uc-icon-meaning-verizon-att-t-mobile\"},{\"title\":\"Wait, why the hell is the ‘race to 5G’ even a race?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637213/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte\"},{\"title\":\"Dear wireless carriers: the 5G hype needs to stop\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"JhbfuF\">Those are just the big tech companies: to my knowledge, every other smartphone manufacturer that sells phones in the US has been co-opted into <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22824763/motorola-moto-edge-5g-uw-2021-review-google-pixel-6-android-mobile-verizon\">producing</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856031/tcl-30-v-5g-30-xe-5g-t-mobile-verizon\">exclusive</a> “5G UW” <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22860504/kyocera-durasport-5g-uw-review-android\">phones</a> for Verizon as well, which has until now meant mmWave. It’s been such a hard rule that when analyst Anshel Sag spotted the phone’s spec sheet, he immediately raised the possibility <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anshelsag/status/1501261486806556674\">that Verizon might not carry the new iPhone SE at all</a>.</p><div id=\"QC5A8s\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Notice that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhoneSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#iPhoneSE</a> won't have mmWave <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/5G?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#5G</a> so it might not be available on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Verizon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Verizon</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hGgD6W25dd\">https://t.co/hGgD6W25dd</a></p>— Anshel Sag (@anshelsag) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anshelsag/status/1501261486806556674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"gQxhiX\">And yet, it will — because Verizon doesn’t need to pretend it cares about millimeter wave anymore. In fact, the company’s already rebranded away from it.</p><p id=\"n1e9la\">Originally, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18119818/verizon-5g-network-demo-att-qualcomm-summit-snapdragon-hawaii\">cellular industry executives told me</a> that millimeter wave was key because 5G needed to wow people with speed. But the joke since day one has been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295600/verizon-5g-network-first-tests-data-speed\">that it’s a scavenger hunt</a>: fast when you find the one street corner where it works, but walk down the street or enter a building, and the signal evaporates. </p><p id=\"o9baYj\">But this January 22nd, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891634/faa-att-verizon-5g-c-band-rollout-battle-airlines-buffer-zones\">over the protests of the airline industry</a>, Verizon flipped the switch <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available\">on C-band 5G</a>, a best-of-both-worlds chunk of radio spectrum with far longer range than millimeter wave and far better speeds than low-band 5G. After <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band\">years of the industry promising that 5G would get better</a>, Verizon’s results <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available\">suddenly looked great</a>.  </p><p id=\"uTeTVU\">And because Verizon loves to look great, it’s <em>already</em> redefined its “5G Ultra Wideband” branding. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22914668/5g-uw-uc-icon-meaning-verizon-att-t-mobile\">Midband 5G is <em>also</em> “5G UW”</a> as of February. </p><p id=\"Egnd8k\"> In January, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220105105459/https://www.verizon.com/support/5g-mobile-faqs/\">the company’s own website defining these terms read</a>:</p><blockquote><p id=\"LyMu6K\">5G Ultra Wideband is Verizon’s highest performing 5G. Our 5G Ultra Wideband network uses high band (mmWave) spectrum to deliver a top-of-the-line 5G experience. </p></blockquote><p id=\"OleXE9\">Today, <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/support/5g-mobile-faqs/#difference\">it reads</a>: </p><blockquote><p id=\"UcNxHD\">5G Ultra Wideband is Verizon’s highest performing 5G. Our 5G Ultra Wideband network uses high band (mmWave) <strong>and mid-band (C-band) spectrum</strong> to deliver a top-of-the-line 5G experience. </p></blockquote><p id=\"yyEL4I\">Funny, that.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"BpYh3S\"><q>Yes, the iPhone SE supports C-Band</q></aside></div><p id=\"QbwBfo\">But now that Verizon has reoriented its network around C-band — and invested heavily, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile\">$45.4 billion just for the spectrum alone</a> — it has no more reason to push millimeter-wave devices that barely deliver on 5G’s promise. What it needs is for people’s first 5G phone to actually give them a good 5G experience, and that’s exactly what the new iPhone SE is poised to do: those who upgrade from a previous model have the opportunity to go straight from LTE to C-band 5G. It’s one of the first major phones to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone/cellular/\">support C-band out of the box</a>.</p><p id=\"1m1kU5\">I don’t think we’ve seen the end of 5G marketing bullshit, mind you: you may wonder for a long time to come whether you’re actually on Verizon’s C-band or millimeter-wave spectrum because of how the carrier now puts both of them under the same umbrella. There’s still plenty of room for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile\">AT&amp;T-esque labeling shenanigans</a> in areas where coverage isn’t as good as a carrier would like it to look, too. That’s been AT&amp;T’s version of the fake-it-until-you-make-it strategy <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172355/att-fake-5g-logo-rolling-out-samsung-lg\">from the start</a>. </p><p id=\"5HNmGi\">But at least we can stop pretending that barely-there millimeter wave is the future. It only took three years, countless billions of dollars, an entirely different chunk of spectrum, and a lot of misdirection to make 5G a consumer reality — at least in densely populated cities and parts of cities around the country.  </p>",
