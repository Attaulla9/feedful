Each phone has a new design, with new components that put them ahead of 2021’s leading Android phones. As for the S22 Ultra, it absorbed the Galaxy Note’s coolest trick of having an S-Pen built-in. If you want to jump right into our hands-on coverage, you can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22917015/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-screen-price-specs-note\">check out our early impressions with the hardware right here</a> or in the video below.</p><p id=\"mmCWnd\">Though, there’s a chance that you’re already sold on the improvements and changes made to this year’s lineup. If that’s the case, I’m going to get right to it and tell you how to preorder the S22 phones so you can get them on launch day.</p><aside id=\"5jlXEw\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Samsung’s new tablets go bigger than ever\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22923565/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-plus-tablets-android-price-specs-features\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"vbeXSS\">Order before 2/24 to get preorder bonuses</h2><p id=\"ct8cAZ\">No matter where you preorder a Samsung Galaxy S22 from, doing so before Thursday, February 24th, will ensure that you get Samsung’s preorder bonus. This includes allowing you to jump up to the next storage tier at no extra cost. For instance, you can get the 256GB model for the price of the 128GB model and the 512GB S22 Ultra for the price of a 256GB model (all S22 models start at 128GB of storage, but only the S22 Ultra goes beyond 256GB of storage). That’s pretty great.</p><p id=\"ZOgOdH\">In addition, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1765650461960167884\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Verge </em>readers can get $250 of Samsung credit by preordering the S22 Ultra</a> (normally, Samsung gives just $200). The S22 Plus will net you $150 of credit, or $100 with the S22, which you can use toward the purchase of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865673/samsung-freestyle-portable-lifestyle-projector-not-olds\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Freestyle projector</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy Watch 4</a>.
