With tablets, smartphones, and even handhelds like the Steam Deck diluting the marketable needs of owning a laptop, there isn’t much space for mini laptops beyond the simple joy of owning a fun-sized version of a traditional computer. </p><p id=\"RoetJy\">But that’s not stopping DIY-er Penk Chen from <a href=\"http://penkesu.computer\">building their own handheld PC</a> called the Penkesu — a retro-futuristic ultraportable laptop with a mechanical keyboard. It could very well have existed as a working sci-fi movie prop in the ’90s or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/10/8/13201472/kelly-rowland-2002-excel-text\">an R&amp;B video plot device in 2002</a>.</p><div id=\"9dxyox\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hacker voice: I’m in <a href=\"https://t.co/CA7jxTMnhe\">pic.twitter.com/CA7jxTMnhe</a></p>— Penk Chen (@penk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/penk/status/1492715339997925376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 13, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"CAz4tL\">The case for the Penkesu is built using 3D printed parts paired with hinges designed for the Game Boy Advance SP. The clamshell lid is fitted with a wide 400 x 1,280 7.9-inch capacitive touch screen, wired through the hinge with a ribbon cable carrying the HDMI signal to a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W at the base.</p><p id=\"vF6SCW\">Then a USB interface with charging, plus a Li-ion battery round off the main computer components, following Chen’s goal to use a minimal amount of electronics. All that’s left for the Penkesu is the keyboard, which consists of an Arduino controller with low-profile Kailh Choc V1 switches, low profiles keycaps, and the rest of the electronics.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/udjYyH5f3nu_fPTIYh8XnQJJVfg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23241795/penkesu_1.computer_assembly_wiring.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Penk Chen via GitHub</cite>      <figcaption><em>The innards of the Penkesu</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"uxpMFq\">The result is a swanky handheld computer that kind of reminds me of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21542278/raspberry-pi-400-keyboard-computer-arm-release-date-news-features\">Raspberry Pi 400</a> compact keyboard that houses an ARM-powered computer — but with a screen.</p><p id=\"virmKO\">This isn’t the first retro-tastic Raspberry Pi laptop we’ve seen, as there was also the apocalypse surviving <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/27/20983472/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit-apocalypse-cyberdeck-build-jay-doscher\">Raspberry Pi cyberdeck computer</a>. Like the Penkesu, it also has a mechanical keyboard. But instead of a compact design, the cyberdeck’s components are wrapped in a rugged water-proof pelican camera case.</p><p id=\"ZSSvxR\">Small laptop designs have gone through phases; at various points, manufacturers raced to build compact and affordable <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/19/14647472/gpd-pocket-netbooks-are-awesome\">internet-focused netbooks</a> or joined Intel’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/16/3867334/intel-on-all-day-battery-life-we-really-mean-it-this-time\">war on the MacBook Air</a> with Ultrabooks. But handheld PCs like the super desirable clutch-style Sony VAIO P could never quite catch on. In the case of the VAIO P, this was because it was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/30/13473970/sony-vaio-p-2016-review-tokyo-thrift\">not very usable</a> due to the slow Intel Atom processor, odd 8-inch 1600 x 786 resolution screen, and a nearly $900 price tag.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"sony vaio p\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xe55Eywj7U-Mpuw08EC4UvrjXoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6072189/16_VGN-P70H.1391682298.0.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>Would be cool if manufacturers made compact computers like the Sony VAIO P again.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"yj1Tey\">But if you loved the form factor of the VIAO P and have a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17120764/raspberry-pi-button-sound-guide-how-to-diy\">use case for a Raspberry Pi</a>, then maybe this cool retro handheld is something for you. If you can’t think of a reason to build one, just remember it could be the perfect computer for <a href=\"https://hackertyper.net\">hackers</a>.</p><p id=\"dkTP0Y\">If you’re thinking of taking on the project, Penk Chen has posted all the info you need <a href=\"https://github.com/penk/penkesu\">on GitHub</a>, including the 3D printable STL files. And yes, putting in a Matrix wallpaper will actually be tasteful on this device.</p>",
