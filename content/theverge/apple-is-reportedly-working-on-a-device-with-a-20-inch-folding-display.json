Last week, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/21/fodlable-iphone-delay-macbook-rumor/\">Young brought attention to Apple’s supposed plans</a> to develop a device with a large, folding screen, and Gurman has added some more depth to this rumor. </p><p id=\"QsHyRH\">Gurman claims the device will feature a dual-screen display that omits a physical keyboard and trackpad — navigating and typing on the device will be entirely touchscreen-based. In terms of a potential release date, Gurman cites Young’s prediction of 2026, around the same time <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789615/apple-self-driving-car-project-titan-custom-processor-ev\">Apple’s rumored car is set to launch</a>.</p><p id=\"YtnTpt\">Lenovo has already done something similar with its ThinkPad X1 Fold, which sports a 13-inch display that folds in the center to become a touchscreen laptop. But as my colleague Monica Chin notes in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review\">our review of the device</a>, Lenovo hasn’t perfected the technology just yet. With a potential release set as far back as 2026, Apple has quite a bit of time to get things right — that is, if the foldable device ever materializes.</p>",
