Eventually, their organically lit pixels can wear, and some have understandably been worried that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review\">the OLED-equipped Nintendo Switch</a>, released last October, might eventually succumb to burn-in. The good news? According to one test, it might take 3,600 hours of constant play on a static screen to even <em>begin</em> to see the first signs of that dreaded screen malady. </p><p id=\"ckrE3f\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaC5RbGAeVo\">YouTuber Wulff Den reports</a> that after five months leaving a Nintendo Switch OLED turned on, plugged into a charger, leaving a static shot of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>’s Link effectively staring into the sun, he’s only now <em>finally</em> seeing some ghosting. And it’s not a lot, as you’ll see for yourself in the video embedded above. (Wulff Den <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crFifvVwSaQ\">also tested at 1,800</a> hours, and didn’t see much effect back then.)</p><p id=\"6iVNap\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22716811/nintendo-switch-oled-model-burn-in-image-retention\">As my colleague Chris Welch told you</a> at launch, burn-in isn’t quite the fear it used to be with OLED screens, as the technology’s come a long way, both in terms of OLED subpixel longevity and built-in software protections. Sometimes, those protections can even be a little too aggressive, as I explain <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv#comments\">in my review of LG’s 48-inch C1 OLED TV</a>. But they’re there, and even if burn-in still exists, whatever Nintendo’s doing seems to be effective.</p><p id=\"YSkOsa\">By the way: the Nintendo Switch just turned five this past week.
