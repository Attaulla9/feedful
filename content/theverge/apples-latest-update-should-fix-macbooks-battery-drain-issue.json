The release notes for the new version, 12.2.1, say it contains fixes for “an issue for Intel-based Mac computers that may cause the battery to drain during sleep when connected to Bluetooth peripherals.” </p><p id=\"2SSewO\">Before Thursday’s updates, some users reported their MacBooks’ batteries would drain while the computer was asleep, sometimes even reaching 0 percent charge overnight. While <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/01/macbook-overnight-battery-drain/\">there was evidence</a> that Bluetooth was the culprit, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/shl2lw/2017_mbp_wont_sleep_after_update_to_monterey_122/\">some users reported</a> that turning off Bluetooth before closing their computers didn’t help, making it slightly unclear what the issue was. Now, Apple’s said it’s specifically fixing an issue with Bluetooth — hopefully, it’ll work for everyone.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"wq4GGT\"><q>It’s an Apple update day</q></aside></div><p id=\"U7Zud3\">Apple also released updates for iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS on Thursday. If you’ve got an iPhone or iPad, it’s probably best to install the 15.3.1 \tupdate as soon as you can — Apple’s security page says it’s made to fix a security flaw that may have been actively exploited. <a href=\"https://appletrack.com/apple-releases-ios-15-3-1-with-accessibility-and-security-updates/\"><em>AppleTrack</em> notes</a> that the update also solves a bug with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/10/apple-releases-watchos-8-4-2-with-bug-fixes/\">a braille-related accessibility feature</a>. watchOS 8.4.2 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/10/apple-releases-watchos-8-4-2-with-bug-fixes/\">appears to be relatively minor</a>, with Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\">not listing any security updates</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LWWlWUIutAsZg_2u5iU9Vm1wFFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23233056/Screen_Shot_2022_02_10_at_11.18.14.png\">      <figcaption><em>The update note doesn’t make any mention of Apple Silicon-based Macs experiencing battery drain.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"rFjTWx\">To update your Mac, go to System Preferences &gt; Software Update.
