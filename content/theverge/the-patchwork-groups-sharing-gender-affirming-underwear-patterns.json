Decades later, that title — given to the many men whose duties included sewing — has now become something of a rallying cry for queer sewists like Martinez, who put gender affirmation at the center of their creations. Martinez and many others are updating their craft to subvert status quo designs that don’t quite fit, building, instead, a world of underwear, lingerie, and intimates in which everybody (and body) is welcome. </p><p id=\"QPOnMp\">“I have always been really particular about the way clothes fit; I have very sensitive skin and some skin allergies and some sensory stuff,” says Martinez, who uses both they and she pronouns. In the realm of underwear, this means that it often takes her months to find the <em>perfect</em> pair. So, knowing how to use a sewing machine, they eventually just decided to make their own.</p><p id=\"aEZvlS\">When it comes to getting dressed, gender affirmation can mean a myriad of things: a celebration of oneself and one’s body, functional — and perhaps unconventional — tailoring, and, of course, comfort. But there’s not a lot of accessible information on the topic out there, Martinez says. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"ZawJqI\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWoYqrFtTo7/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" ><div > <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWoYqrFtTo7/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"  target=\"_blank\"> <div > <div ></div> <div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div></div><div ></div> <div ><svg width=\"50px\" height=\"50px\" viewbox=\"0 0 60 60\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"https://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><g stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><g transform=\"translate(-511.000000, -20.000000)\" fill=\"#000000\"><g><path d=\"M556.869,30.41 C554.814,30.41 553.148,32.076 553.148,34.131 C553.148,36.186 554.814,37.852 556.869,37.852 C558.924,37.852 560.59,36.186 560.59,34.131 C560.59,32.076 558.924,30.41 556.869,30.41 M541,60.657 C535.114,60.657 530.342,55.887 530.342,50 C530.342,44.114 535.114,39.342 541,39.342 C546.887,39.342 551.658,44.114 551.658,50 C551.658,55.887 546.887,60.657 541,60.657 M541,33.886 C532.1,33.886 524.886,41.1 524.886,50 C524.886,58.899 532.1,66.113 541,66.113 C549.9,66.113 557.115,58.899 557.115,50 C557.115,41.1 549.9,33.886 541,33.886 M565.378,62.101 C565.244,65.022 564.756,66.606 564.346,67.663 C563.803,69.06 563.154,70.057 562.106,71.106 C561.058,72.155 560.06,72.803 558.662,73.347 C557.607,73.757 556.021,74.244 553.102,74.378 C549.944,74.521 548.997,74.552 541,74.552 C533.003,74.552 532.056,74.521 528.898,74.378 C525.979,74.244 524.393,73.757 523.338,73.347 C521.94,72.803 520.942,72.155 519.894,71.106 C518.846,70.057 518.197,69.06 517.654,67.663 C517.244,66.606 516.755,65.022 516.623,62.101 C516.479,58.943 516.448,57.996 516.448,50 C516.448,42.003 516.479,41.056 516.623,37.899 C516.755,34.978 517.244,33.391 517.654,32.338 C518.197,30.938 518.846,29.942 519.894,28.894 C520.942,27.846 521.94,27.196 523.338,26.654 C524.393,26.244 525.979,25.756 528.898,25.623 C532.057,25.479 533.004,25.448 541,25.448 C548.997,25.448 549.943,25.479 553.102,25.623 C556.021,25.756 557.607,26.244 558.662,26.654 C560.06,27.196 561.058,27.846 562.106,28.894 C563.154,29.942 563.803,30.938 564.346,32.338 C564.756,33.391 565.244,34.978 565.378,37.899 C565.522,41.056 565.552,42.003 565.552,50 C565.552,57.996 565.522,58.943 565.378,62.101 M570.82,37.631 C570.674,34.438 570.167,32.258 569.425,30.349 C568.659,28.377 567.633,26.702 565.965,25.035 C564.297,23.368 562.623,22.342 560.652,21.575 C558.743,20.834 556.562,20.326 553.369,20.18 C550.169,20.033 549.148,20 541,20 C532.853,20 531.831,20.033 528.631,20.18 C525.438,20.326 523.257,20.834 521.349,21.575 C519.376,22.342 517.703,23.368 516.035,25.035 C514.368,26.702 513.342,28.377 512.574,30.349 C511.834,32.258 511.326,34.438 511.181,37.631 C511.035,40.831 511,41.851 511,50 C511,58.147 511.035,59.17 511.181,62.369 C511.326,65.562 511.834,67.743 512.574,69.651 C513.342,71.625 514.368,73.296 516.035,74.965 C517.703,76.634 519.376,77.658 521.349,78.425 C523.257,79.167 525.438,79.673 528.631,79.82 C531.831,79.965 532.853,80.001 541,80.001 C549.148,80.001 550.169,79.965 553.369,79.82 C556.562,79.673 558.743,79.167 560.652,78.425 C562.623,77.658 564.297,76.634 565.965,74.965 C567.633,73.296 568.659,71.625 569.425,69.651 C570.167,67.743 570.674,65.562 570.82,62.369 C570.966,59.17 571,58.147 571,50 C571,41.851 570.966,40.831 570.82,37.631\"></path></g></g></g></svg></div><div > <div >View this post on Instagram</div></div><div ></div> <div ><div> <div ></div> <div ></div> <div ></div></div><div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div><div > <div ></div> <div ></div> <div ></div></div></div> <div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div></a><p ><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWoYqrFtTo7/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"  target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Sew Queer (@sewqueer)</a></p></div></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script></div></div><p id=\"4AAB3z\">They’re right: communities like <a href=\"https://www.sewqueer.org/\">Sew Queer</a> and <a href=\"https://thesewcialists.com/\">The Sewcialists</a> (which shut down in 2021) have served as digital gathering spaces for queer people who want to make their own intimates. But it’s a pieced-together effort of sharing information and pattern hacks — worlds away from the mainstream sewing companies who have been mass-producing patterns for generations of (mostly) women. Queers are searching for something often overlooked: binders, gaffs, lingerie for trans women, boxer briefs for nonbinary folks; designs that have simply never existed in the universe of McCall’s or Simplicity patterns.</p><p id=\"u8XAAI\">While conventional, gendered bra patterns are a dime a dozen, Emilia Bergoglio, a queer sewist in Tokyo, Japan, saw that there were “basically zero resources” when it came to sewing binders. It led them to write a <a href=\"https://thesewcialists.com/2020/08/17/allchestswelcome-and-the-great-binder-story-part-i/\">blog post</a> titled “The Great Binder Story” for <a href=\"https://thesewcialists.com/\">The Sewcialists</a> as part of a larger series called <a href=\"https://thesewcialists.com/category/theme-months/all-chests-welcome/\">All Chests Welcome</a>, which cobbled together knowledge and how-to’s from a diverse array of hobbyists. </p><p id=\"ZHg2uv\">“Binders are essential for many trans folks, and they are not cheap,” they say. “Sometimes it’s impossible to find something that fully represents who you are in the market, so sewing helps you with that. You can create it yourself. The fit, the fabric, the silhouette — it’s very empowering.” </p><p id=\"Ds9ISN\">The Sew Queer blog has a similar <a href=\"https://www.sewqueer.org/underwear-sewing-resources\">page of resources</a> more specifically aimed at queer sewing, full of links to tutorials, Facebook community groups, patterns, and suggested materials — which range from posts like the <a href=\"https://sewhere.com/floozy-doozy-diy-underwear-strap-on-hack/\">Floozy Doozy DIY Underwear Strap On Hack</a>, which comes with a complete pattern available for purchase, to a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/229867010690217\">Facebook group hosted by Rad Patterns</a>, where folks can share pattern hacks, adjustments, and alterations to better fit their needs. It’s a small but growing Rolodex of vital information. </p><div><aside id=\"bzeai6\"><q>“Fashion is very much about that interface between your feeling about who you are and who wider society thinks you are”</q></aside></div><p id=\"Otyu63\">The queer community has been rooted in a do-it-yourself mentality for generations, making their own clothes, media, music, and so forth, says fashion historian Valerie Steele — who, in 2013, curated the FIT exhibition “<a href=\"https://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/queer-history.php\">A Queer History of Fashion: From the Closet to the Catwalk</a>.” Because clothing is one of the clearest forms of nonverbal communication, it has been essential in enabling under-the-radar queer dialogue. </p><p id=\"sP4hrm\">“When you start looking at fashion, you realize there were all these hidden histories — hidden at least to the general public now, not necessarily to people at the time,” she says. “If you look at your sexuality, your gender, your sexual orientation, your sexual presentation to the world — all of those things are related to your identity, and fashion is very much about that interface between your feeling about who you are and who wider society thinks you are.”</p><p id=\"z7Inrm\">From this standpoint, it was clear to Martinez that the queers who could sew are often making their own undies. The queers who couldn’t needed an alternative. That’s what led Martinez to start <a href=\"https://www.aquaunderwearslc.com/\">Aqua Underwear</a>, a boxer brief (for now) brand that began mid-pandemic out of her home in Salt Lake City, Utah. “At that point, a lot of people started talking to me about their underwear frustrations. Underwear isn’t necessarily a casual conversation you have with people, but when they find out that you make underwear, all of a sudden it’s like, yeah, everyone wants to talk to you about underwear!” </p><div class=\"c-float-left\"><div id=\"XLg51j\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CE5NbA2hARl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" ><div > <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CE5NbA2hARl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"  target=\"_blank\"> <div > <div ></div> <div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div></div><div ></div> <div ><svg width=\"50px\" height=\"50px\" viewbox=\"0 0 60 60\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"https://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><g stroke=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><g transform=\"translate(-511.000000, -20.000000)\" fill=\"#000000\"><g><path d=\"M556.869,30.41 C554.814,30.41 553.148,32.076 553.148,34.131 C553.148,36.186 554.814,37.852 556.869,37.852 C558.924,37.852 560.59,36.186 560.59,34.131 C560.59,32.076 558.924,30.41 556.869,30.41 M541,60.657 C535.114,60.657 530.342,55.887 530.342,50 C530.342,44.114 535.114,39.342 541,39.342 C546.887,39.342 551.658,44.114 551.658,50 C551.658,55.887 546.887,60.657 541,60.657 M541,33.886 C532.1,33.886 524.886,41.1 524.886,50 C524.886,58.899 532.1,66.113 541,66.113 C549.9,66.113 557.115,58.899 557.115,50 C557.115,41.1 549.9,33.886 541,33.886 M565.378,62.101 C565.244,65.022 564.756,66.606 564.346,67.663 C563.803,69.06 563.154,70.057 562.106,71.106 C561.058,72.155 560.06,72.803 558.662,73.347 C557.607,73.757 556.021,74.244 553.102,74.378 C549.944,74.521 548.997,74.552 541,74.552 C533.003,74.552 532.056,74.521 528.898,74.378 C525.979,74.244 524.393,73.757 523.338,73.347 C521.94,72.803 520.942,72.155 519.894,71.106 C518.846,70.057 518.197,69.06 517.654,67.663 C517.244,66.606 516.755,65.022 516.623,62.101 C516.479,58.943 516.448,57.996 516.448,50 C516.448,42.003 516.479,41.056 516.623,37.899 C516.755,34.978 517.244,33.391 517.654,32.338 C518.197,30.938 518.846,29.942 519.894,28.894 C520.942,27.846 521.94,27.196 523.338,26.654 C524.393,26.244 525.979,25.756 528.898,25.623 C532.057,25.479 533.004,25.448 541,25.448 C548.997,25.448 549.943,25.479 553.102,25.623 C556.021,25.756 557.607,26.244 558.662,26.654 C560.06,27.196 561.058,27.846 562.106,28.894 C563.154,29.942 563.803,30.938 564.346,32.338 C564.756,33.391 565.244,34.978 565.378,37.899 C565.522,41.056 565.552,42.003 565.552,50 C565.552,57.996 565.522,58.943 565.378,62.101 M570.82,37.631 C570.674,34.438 570.167,32.258 569.425,30.349 C568.659,28.377 567.633,26.702 565.965,25.035 C564.297,23.368 562.623,22.342 560.652,21.575 C558.743,20.834 556.562,20.326 553.369,20.18 C550.169,20.033 549.148,20 541,20 C532.853,20 531.831,20.033 528.631,20.18 C525.438,20.326 523.257,20.834 521.349,21.575 C519.376,22.342 517.703,23.368 516.035,25.035 C514.368,26.702 513.342,28.377 512.574,30.349 C511.834,32.258 511.326,34.438 511.181,37.631 C511.035,40.831 511,41.851 511,50 C511,58.147 511.035,59.17 511.181,62.369 C511.326,65.562 511.834,67.743 512.574,69.651 C513.342,71.625 514.368,73.296 516.035,74.965 C517.703,76.634 519.376,77.658 521.349,78.425 C523.257,79.167 525.438,79.673 528.631,79.82 C531.831,79.965 532.853,80.001 541,80.001 C549.148,80.001 550.169,79.965 553.369,79.82 C556.562,79.673 558.743,79.167 560.652,78.425 C562.623,77.658 564.297,76.634 565.965,74.965 C567.633,73.296 568.659,71.625 569.425,69.651 C570.167,67.743 570.674,65.562 570.82,62.369 C570.966,59.17 571,58.147 571,50 C571,41.851 570.966,40.831 570.82,37.631\"></path></g></g></g></svg></div><div > <div >View this post on Instagram</div></div><div ></div> <div ><div> <div ></div> <div ></div> <div ></div></div><div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div><div > <div ></div> <div ></div> <div ></div></div></div> <div > <div ></div> <div ></div></div></a><p ><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CE5NbA2hARl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"  target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Aqua Underwear (@aquaunderwear)</a></p></div></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script></div></div><p id=\"uUrRys\">Martinez was tapping into a market that exploded during the pandemic; women’s lingerie alone was worth $42 billion in 2020, and is expected to reach <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/720288/lingerie-retail-market-value/\">$78.66 billion by 2027</a>. Of course, those statistics don’t include the nascent categories like gender-affirming and gender-expansive underwear that makers like Martinez specialize in. </p><p id=\"4aVnPt\">It’s a niche whose growth is driven by community need, says Rae Hill, founder of <a href=\"https://origamicustoms.com/\">Origami Customs</a>, which offers custom, hand-sewn lingerie.
