The move surprised a bunch of G Suite users that have been using the service with custom domains, and now, Microsoft is trying to entice G Suite users to pay for Microsoft 365 instead with a 60 percent discount offer.</p><p id=\"TiBx2I\">“If you’re a small business that’s relied on G Suite legacy free edition, we couldn’t help but notice you might be in the market for a new solution,” <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fblog%2F2022%2F02%2F10%2Fa-special-offer-for-small-businesses-using-googles-legacy-g-suite%2F\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">says Jared Spataro</a>, head of Microsoft 365. “We’ve got news for you: today, you can get a 60 percent discount on a 12-month Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Business Standard, or Business Premium subscription, along with the help you need to make the move.”</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"X73kB6\"><q>Microsoft is trying to entice G Suite users over to Office</q></aside></div><p id=\"T8BQvN\">The cheeky offer is <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fswitch-to-microsoft-365\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available on Microsoft’s website</a> and includes support for custom domains, Microsoft Teams access, Office apps, and OneDrive cloud storage. Microsoft is also including a year of <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/business-assist-for-microsoft-365-37deb8fe-61cc-4cf9-9ad1-1c8d93475070\">Business Assist</a> for Microsoft 355, which helps businesses migrate to Microsoft 365 more easily. The offer is exclusive to G Suite legacy free edition users who purchase a 12-month Microsoft 365 subscription by August 2nd, 2022.</p><p id=\"zMNRgP\">Some G Suite legacy users might want to wait on a new solution from Google, though. After a backlash, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/60217?hl=en#zippy=%2Ccan-i-keep-my-g-suite-legacy-free-edition-subscription%2Cif-i-dont-want-to-upgrade-to-a-paid-subscription-can-i-keep-my-data%2Cif-i-dont-want-to-upgrade-to-a-paid-subscription-can-i-transfer-my-data\">Google says it plans</a> to “provide an option for you to move your non-Google Workspace paid content and most of your data to a no-cost option.” We’re still waiting on full details from Google, but it sounds like G Suite legacy users will be able to transition to a free Gmail account without premium features like custom email domains or multi-account management.</p><p id=\"XmhCTa\">This should hopefully solve some headaches for people who have relied on their free G Suite accounts for their YouTube channels or who have used the account for Google Play purchases. For others who used the free G Suite option for family or business email accounts on a custom domain, it looks like the only option is to start paying or move to competitors like Microsoft 365.</p>",
