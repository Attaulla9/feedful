Activision Blizzard is delaying a <em>Call of Duty</em> title that had been scheduled to release in 2023, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-22/activision-to-delay-next-year-s-planned-call-of-duty-game?sref=xuVirdpv\">according to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier</a>. </p><p id=\"L9fEy4\">Activision is pushing the game, which Schreier says is being developed by <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em> maker Treyarch, after last year’s annual release, <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>, didn’t meet expectations. That led executives to “suspect that it had been cannibalized by the previous year’s game,” Schreier reports. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22941636/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-sec-filing-came-together\">A recent SEC filing</a> said that <em>Vanguard </em>failed to meet Activision’s fourth-quarter projections. </p><p id=\"FWrdjP\">However, it seems that Activision will release other <em>Call of Duty</em> content. The 2022 title, which Activision has already announced will be a sequel to 2019’s <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, will get “a steady stream of additional content,” Schreier says. There’s also a new free-to-play online game that will be available in 2023 as well, and it appears that will be in addition to the eventual release of <em>Warzone 2</em>, a game that Schreier <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1496259246001905670\">mentioned in a tweet</a>. </p><p id=\"6xzOGB\">An Activision spokesperson didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><div id=\"m6qg4J\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A new premium Call of Duty has come out every year since 2005. Next year's offerings will include a new free-to-play game as well as content for Warzone 2 and 2022's Modern Warfare.</p>— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1496259246001905670?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"YlRtPJ\">Activision announced initial details about the <em>Modern Warfare</em> sequel and a “new <em>Warzone</em> experience” (which is perhaps the <em>Warzone 2</em> Schreier mentioned) <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/11/22929492/call-of-duty-warzone-sequel-new-experience-infinity-ward\">earlier in February</a>, and both are scheduled to come out this year. While Activision said they will be “designed together from the ground-up,” it’s unclear if the new <em>Warzone </em>is a full sequel or a big update to the existing game. Both will be powered by a new engine. </p><p id=\"E4s2bA\">Activision has been under significant scrutiny due to California’s lawsuit alleging it fostered a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay\">culture of “constant sexual harassment”</a> and labor protests from staffers, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/25/22901563/raven-software-union-game-workers-alliance-activision-blizzard\">some who work on <em>Call of Duty</em></a>. Microsoft announced in January it had struck a deal to acquire the company for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch\">$68.7 billion</a>, though the deal isn’t expected to close until sometime in Microsoft’s fiscal year 2023, which begins in July. </p>",
