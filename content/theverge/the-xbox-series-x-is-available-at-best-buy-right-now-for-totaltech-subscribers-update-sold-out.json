Best Buy has the coveted <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgp5UITfDQc\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">console in stock for its usual price of $499.99</a>, though, the drop is exclusive to paying Totaltech subscribers. If you weren’t already aware, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgGy8u8DO6B\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Totaltech</a> is Best Buy’s premium membership, one that combines tech support, product protection, and access to exclusive console restocks for $199.99 per year. It’s an expensive service, though if you feel you’re still struggling to find Microsoft’s next-gen console, it should improve your chances of landing a console.</p><p id=\"MQ0Cg5\">If you are a Totaltech member, make sure you’ve logged into your account ahead of time, double-check that your billing and shipping information is correct, and stay persistent. To get in line, make sure to click the “Add to Cart” button, and be prepared for Best Buy to ask you to verify your information. Also, don’t give up if the Series X appears to sell out — Best Buy often releases consoles in waves of 10-minute intervals, so you may have a second chance.</p><aside id=\"M11OlQ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review\"},{\"title\":\"Why the PS5 paywall isn’t worthwhile at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"1Lgs6T\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10978780\"></div></div><p id=\"OQ0BOS\">If you don’t manage to score a console today, however, keep your head up.
