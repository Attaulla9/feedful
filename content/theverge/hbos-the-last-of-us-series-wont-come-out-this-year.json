We haven’t announced an air date yet,” Bloys said. “But it’s not 2022. They’re still shooting in Calgary.” He said something similar <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/02/the-last-of-us-premiere-date-update-video-game-adaptation-hbo-1234934882/\">to <em>Deadline</em></a>, too:<em> </em>“[<em>The Last of Us</em>] is not going to air in 2022 — they are still shooting in Canada. I imagine you will see it in ’23.”</p><p id=\"PkLGwt\">While it’s a bummer that the show won’t be out in 2022, I’m just fine with HBO taking all the time it needs. <em>The Last of Us</em> is one of my favorite video games, and I really want to see HBO do it justice, so I am okay waiting to see the show until it’s ready.</p><p id=\"KUgjBy\">The series will star <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show\"><em>The Mandalorian’s</em> Pedro Pascal as Joel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont\"><em>Game of Thrones</em> fan-favorite Bella Ramsey as Ellie</a>, and Merle Dandridge will be reprising <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457686/merle-dandridge-hbo-the-last-of-us-adapatation-live-action\">her role as Marlene from the games</a>. Neil Druckmann, the creative director behind the game series, is an executive producer and co-writer of the television show, and <em>Chernobyl’s </em>Craig Mazin is also serving as a writer and exec producer.</p><p id=\"1ToqXE\">The upcoming show is part of what seems to be a big effort from Sony to make film and TV adaptations of its games.
