Whether you want to place a voice assistant in every room or simply a touchscreen-enabled model to showcase recipes in the kitchen, there's an Echo device for just about every occasion and use case. </p><p id=\"SZtlb8\">Regardless of why you might want one, there’s always a way to save on an Echo device, from the last-gen Echo Dot to Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10. Even when they’re selling for full price, Amazon offers a 25 percent discount when you trade in select devices, meaning there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are on sale. </p><aside id=\"868HqZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best Kindle deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21539047/best-amazon-kindle-deals\"},{\"title\":\"The best smart displays for every home\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"zNwIju\">The best Echo Dot deals</h2><p id=\"maQ5h0\">Last year, Amazon released the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker\">fourth generation of the Echo Dot</a>, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features\">third-gen Echo Dot</a>, which retains the familiar dot shape and retails for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$39.99 at Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgoH6E6qPbd\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>. The latter retailer is also currently offering $10 off the price of two — if you’re looking to outfit your home with multiple smart speakers — while Amazon is offering the third-gen Dot <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z4G7VCH?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">with a Sengled smart bulb for $47.98</a>.</p><p id=\"3BDRU5\">As for the latest Echo Dot, we saw it drop to an all-time low of $29.99 around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Right now, however, it’s only <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available at Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702&amp;subid1=VergeAmazonDeals021422\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>. and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $49.99, its full retail price.

The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kids Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, including audiobooks and games.</p><p id=\"LmKSqg\">The Kids Edition is currently <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available for $59.99 at Amazon</a>, its standard retail price.

Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the latest Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.</p><p id=\"HdAa8S\">Although we’ve seen the namesake Echo drop to as low as $60 during shopping events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, it’s only available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770246%2F&amp;subid1=VergeAmazonDeals021422\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a> right now for $79.99, its full retail price.

The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">latest edition</a>, which launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2MP camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. </p><p id=\"b8jLZ5\">While we recently saw the latest Echo Show 5 sell for as low as $44.99, it's currently only available at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cfAzhE7JLdJ\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1249033/2092?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals1262022&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-glacier-white%2F-%2FA-82696543\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> for $84.99, the MSRP.</p><div id=\"mVseNr\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10609475\"></div></div><h2 id=\"FiYkkx\">The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals</h2><p id=\"JGaEAZ\">The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kids Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.</p><p id=\"1db3Rn\">Unfortunately, the Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is currently only available for $94.99, its normal retail price, at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1275356/2092?subId1=VergeBestEchoDeals030222&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-kids-chameleon%2F-%2FA-83368169\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and other retailers.</p><h2 id=\"O97UD3\">The best Echo Show 8 deals</h2><p id=\"efoU4U\">Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models, both of which feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers.
