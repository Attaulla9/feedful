It’s a significant military action that could have alarming consequences, and more than 500,000 people have reportedly fled from Ukraine to neighboring countries <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RefugeesMedia/status/1498249979416256512\">as of February 28th</a>. Peace talks between the two countries <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/peace-talks-set-to-begin-as-russian-war-on-ukraine-heads-into-5th-day/\">have begun</a> at the Belarus border.</p><p id=\"ngUeQH\">Tech companies have responded to the crisis in various ways, with the focus on trying to reduce online misinformation and avoid putting Ukrainians in danger. Google has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954426/google-disables-maps-traffic-data-in-ukraine-to-protect-citizens\">disabled Maps traffic data in Ukraine to protect citizens</a>, for example, while Facebook has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954451/facebook-twitter-remove-misinformation-network-russian-propaganda-ukraine-invasion\">removed a Russian misinformation network</a>. But Russia <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22952006/russia-block-twitter-ukraine-invasion-censorship-putin\">has blocked Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950874/russia-facebook-blocked-roskomnadzor-media-censorship\">partially blocked Facebook</a>, which could limit information coming out of the country. And there have been internet outages in Ukraine that have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949115/internet-disruptions-ukraine-kharkiv-russia\">sparked concerns</a> about the possibility of attacks on Ukraine’s internet infrastructure. </p><p id=\"FxfLbk\">Read on for our latest coverage of the crisis. </p>",
