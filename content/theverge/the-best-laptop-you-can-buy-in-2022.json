Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles.</p><p id=\"lfv5g0\">Our current pick for the best laptop of 2022 is the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\">MacBook Air</a>. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. </p><p id=\"SNThzL\">We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. </p><p id=\"31HnuI\">It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2022 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.</p><p id=\"3hnoYs\">In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features\">HP Envy x360 13</a>. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.</p><p id=\"7ABV8A\">Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2022 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Spectre x360 14. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop\">best gaming laptops</a>, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.</p><h1 id=\"4mn8ET\">Best Laptops 2022</h1><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"GJnOwH\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Apple MacBook Air\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cT9WoMfWteu_VLQY3timVCW362k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22046471/vpavic_4291_20201113_0411.0.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2022.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"oTToOm\">1. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\">MacBook Air</a></h2><h3 id=\"rE8ByG\">The best laptop of 2022</h3><p id=\"qIDMjX\">The MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. </p><p id=\"GYCzY0\">Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. </p><p id=\"iDDWFN\">But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. </p><p id=\"ACwNY3\">And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. </p><div id=\"XZkaRR\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10220133\"></div></div><p id=\"8eGPnz\">Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. </p><p id=\"NjPO8F\">Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. </p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"L8pJhA\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Apple MacBook Pro 16\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ZFyiQnXoItiXqw_xDtcn5fN1Pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965891/akrales_211027_4820_0399.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The MacBook Pro is an excellent laptop for video editing and intensive work.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"Ip0i0W\">2. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review\">MacBook Pro (16-inch)</a></h2><h3 id=\"QRlaQ5\">The best creator laptop</h3><p id=\"LyoNCb\">The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the most powerful laptop Apple has ever made. If you’re willing to pay the price (and it’s a steep price), you’ll almost certainly be satisfied with what this machine can do. </p><p id=\"svZAry\">In our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The 16-inch configuration with the M1 Pro processor lasted 16 hours in my testing — making it the longest-lasting laptop we’ve ever reviewed. (The M1 Max configuration doesn’t last quite as long, but still got us through a work day.) </p><p id=\"imgWnf\">Elsewhere, we have basically no complaints about the newest MacBook Pro. It has a gorgeous display that can reach 1,000 nits when playing HDR content. It pairs that with the best set of speakers we’ve ever heard from a laptop. If you’re looking for a machine that can accommodate a demanding workload while also serving as an excellent multimedia device when you’re off the clock, the MacBook Pro 16 is the best device for you. </p><div id=\"T5divl\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10814228\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"Vtnpmk\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Apple MacBook Pro 14\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_dBkr_nqRIuH92oPsOyq4vHHrwI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965906/akrales_211028_4820_0673.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The 14-inch MacBook Pro is another great creator laptop.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"Wh6FfM\">3. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review\">MacBook Pro (14-inch)</a></h2><h3 id=\"7399sH\">A great choice for Mac power users</h3><p id=\"u8MTQ2\">If you’re a creative professional who doesn’t quite want to pay the price of the MacBook Pro 16, or you’re looking for something more compact, you’re probably better suited to the 14-inch MacBook Pro. This device is thinner, lighter, and less expensive than its 16-inch counterpart, but it comes with the same monstrous processor options and the same stellar screen, albeit at a smaller size. </p><p id=\"w3aJPr\">We didn’t see much of a difference in benchmark scores between the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBooks with the same processors — the 14-incher actually outperformed the 16-inchers in some of our tests. The primary difference to consider, apart from the sizes of these devices, is battery life. The 16-inch chassis allows for a significantly bigger battery, and the 16-inch M1 Pro model lasted several hours longer than the 14-inch M1 Pro model did in our testing. </p><p id=\"l8RJE4\">On the outside, Apple has fixed many of the issues that reviewers had with previous MacBook Pro models. There are ports galore on this device, including an HDMI, an SD slot, and multiple Thunderbolt 4 ports. The much-maligned Touchbar is also no more. While you can get plenty of great 14-inch laptops for half the price of this MacBook, it’s the one to buy if money is no object.</p><div id=\"9Bzxgi\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10814206\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"G2y1vr\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: HP Spectre x360 14\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXu0jcRLvUdGZwwpjg3vvbG1mn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279295/mchin_190429_4395_0002.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by MonicaChin / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"O7mXrt\">4. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features\">HP Spectre x360 14</a></h2><h3 id=\"N7xEV5\">The best Windows laptop</h3><p id=\"4nwIVn\">It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. </p><p id=\"xL3xF1\">But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. </p><p id=\"yfMa1S\">On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. </p><p id=\"xxTNW9\">Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.</p><div id=\"ewzfR6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10340665\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"yswF9z\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Asus Zephyrus G15\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOls4hR6yunICRTjJJFN-zK9XjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341889/akrales_210226_4440_0022.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Asus Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop you can buy.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"IXWmtZ\">5. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price\">Asus ROG Zephyrus G15</a></h2><h3 id=\"nxYz9i\">The best gaming laptop in 2022</h3><p id=\"2eqQM4\">At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. </p><p id=\"SxthwN\">Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. </p><div id=\"kJ5hNb\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10385239\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"wW7j6n\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Asus Chromebook Flip CX5\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qCqkZMeiygCM_yaqaQz0F6ak2yA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959808/akrales_211012_4763_0076.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 is a massive, powerful Chromebook.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"Op71aj\">6. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22776850/asus-chromebook-flip-cx5-review-the-15-inch-chromebook-to-beat\">Asus Chromebook Flip CX5</a></h2><h3 id=\"3W3TFs\">The best 15-inch Chromebook</h3><p id=\"wVrlpW\">Asus surprised us this year with its Chromebook Flip CX5, a gorgeous $800 laptop that happens to run Chrome OS. It’s as sturdy and well-built as all kinds of Windows laptops at higher price points, and sports a unique smooth texture. It includes fully-fledged laptop specs, including Intel’s 11th-Gen processors and a 57Wh battery, which provide speedy performance, long battery life, and quick charging. </p><p id=\"tt9eBq\">You get all kinds of ports, including an HDMI and a microSD slot. The speakers sound great, and the keyboard is comfortable. Asus hasn’t skimped on CX5’s chassis or its performance — it’s absolutely the product to buy if you’re looking for a Chromebook with a big screen.</p><div id=\"ga41QP\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10870714\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"XCh4Ai\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: LG Gram 17\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GfTxqQBd93C-ef4Dw31UfHEVW_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411713/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0006.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"SoHxJX\">7. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review\">LG Gram 17</a></h2><h3 id=\"aOmcws\">The best laptop in 2022 for big-screen fans</h3><p id=\"ovDneV\">Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. </p><p id=\"AbftFc\">But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. </p><p id=\"BvoTCC\">Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.</p><div id=\"kJHRXY\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10498451\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"VSwm66\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: HP Envy x360 13\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-3n_PDQBp_EOIUDusfA7A_LYGZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20069599/mchin_200705_4086_0006.0.jpg\">      <cite>Photography by Monica Chin / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"vvpAoT\">8. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features\">HP Envy x360 13</a></h2><h3 id=\"IOuDKK\">The best budget laptop in 2022</h3><p id=\"6ONzJr\">You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. </p><p id=\"5TwdF5\">Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. </p><p id=\"xRbztF\">But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.</p><div id=\"UnaYvt\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9505904\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"9bGBKN\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Dell XPS 13 2-in-1\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t2jDTEOcLfPOaz5wvoUW7fiKiWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22048783/mchin_190211_4302_0012.0.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"NKt5f4\">9. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features\">Dell XPS 13 2-in-1</a></h2><h3 id=\"Ucqsb1\">A great 2-in-1 laptop</h3><p id=\"iLNMXR\">If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. </p><p id=\"dghfZI\">The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. </p><p id=\"BEAGgI\">Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on <em>Rocket League</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, and <em>Overwatch</em>, and even managed 36fps on <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). </p><p id=\"izx3w7\">Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?</p><div id=\"woXzPz\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10220219\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"H5F8sd\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Dell XPS 13\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DlGu9NcyOGiBmZH9uk0wUADgPx0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22007661/mchin_190124_4274_0004.0.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops of 2022.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"Ncv6I8\">10. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features\">Dell XPS 13</a></h2><h3 id=\"w7TWDY\">The best laptop for college</h3><p id=\"6xPrkB\">The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. </p><p id=\"ik0URk\">This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. </p><p id=\"MZCO5H\">My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. </p><p id=\"uN3gSr\">There’s an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price\">OLED model</a> of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model.

It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. </p><p id=\"WdGWMd\">But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.</p><div id=\"TxKHkC\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10498483\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"Vr5Tg8\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Lenovo Chromebook Duet\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M79QGj6leDzJdmoI3tnqqQRv7Cc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19978535/mchin_200512_4018_0001.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great option for budget shoppers.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"MIUCfV\">12. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price\">Lenovo Chromebook Duet</a></h2><h3 id=\"WpIKDR\">The best laptop for students</h3><p id=\"5khaPj\">Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.</p><p id=\"FV5DZN\">The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. </p><p id=\"XiBrWO\">The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. </p><div id=\"GSFbIW\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9505920\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"hvT0ep\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Razer Book 13\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fe8-f1VUQmxBbLTr9bDvEZgu_z4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290553/akrales_210203_4381_0116.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Razer Book 13 proves that Razer is cut out for more than just gaming rigs.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"g8zMV8\">13. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features\">Razer Book 13</a></h2><h3 id=\"sky6IZ\">A stylish, powerful productivity laptop</h3><p id=\"1AVfKp\">Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. </p><p id=\"cAI01n\">On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.</p><div id=\"DRST2I\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10375007\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"eEK1Gs\"><div class=\"c-wide-block\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Lenovo Yoga 9i\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2vNNkwrX84kygHr3-kitt7jV-UY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651293/akrales_20210609_4596_0120.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Lenovo Yoga 9i is a portable entertainment machine.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id=\"zaTcIA\">14. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review\">Lenovo Yoga 9i</a></h2><h3 id=\"DdByBe\">The best multimedia laptop</h3><p id=\"3TMlQz\">Most thin and light laptops share one significant weakness — thin, tinny audio. That’s not the case with the Lenovo Yoga 9i. This 14-inch convertible has a rotating soundbar in its hinge, meaning that no matter how it’s positioned, the speakers face outwards. You can expect clear, booming sound whether you’re using the 9i in tablet, tent, or clamshell mode.</p><p id=\"Bd1MYR\">There’s a lot more to like as well. You get an excellent 1080p touch display and a built-in stylus for easy artwork and note-taking. The 11th-Gen processors deliver satisfactory performance and all-day battery life. The audio quality, screen, and convertible form factor all add up to an unbeatable machine for multimedia entertainment. </p><div id=\"JHuWqw\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10689258\"></div></div><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"5Lb8jp\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Best Laptop 2022: Razer Blade Pro 17\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wTbuRFPJtnUZJ3TpehKO4_lxLYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21820233/mchin_181119_4158_0008.0.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a big Razer Blade for gamers who want thebst.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"iSdaEW\">15. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review\">Razer Blade Pro 17</a></h2><h3 id=\"PNezb4\">A great choice for gamers</h3><p id=\"il4fnj\">The Blade Pro 17 is a super powerful gaming laptop for a high price. It pairs Intel’s 11th-Gen Core processors (a Core i7 or a Core i9) with Nvidia’s RTX 3000 series and a display with up to a 360Hz refresh rate. It’s quite portable for such a powerful gaming laptop, at just 0.8 inches thick. And it only requires one charging brick, so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power.</p><p id=\"965k9S\">There are other things to like, too. It has a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without it being too obnoxious for the office. You can also elect for a 165Hz QHD configuration, if you prefer to game at a higher resolution. While the Blade Pro 17 isn’t cheap, it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.</p><div id=\"hBAh3l\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9505921\"></div></div><aside id=\"LWsjh3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside><p id=\"AOUkel\"> Related:</p><div id=\"lcntiD\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Samsung Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360 first look: OLED for $999|101876\" data-volume-uuid=\"22d4ac801\" data-volume-id=\"101876\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-818\" class=\"volume-video\"></div></div>",
