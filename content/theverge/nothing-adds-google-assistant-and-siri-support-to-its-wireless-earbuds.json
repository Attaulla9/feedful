The addition comes as something of a surprise given Nothing originally <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review\">told <em>Android Central</em></a> it had no plans to add voice assistant support to the Ear 1.</p><p id=\"V2yBwW\">According <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/02/09/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-gain-google-assistant-support-via-firmware-update/\">to <em>9to5Google</em></a><em>, </em>the functionality is rolling out with firmware version 0.6700.1.86, and also supports Amazon’s Alexa in addition to both mobile OS’s native voice assistants. Unfortunately, it sounds like the feature is currently a little buggy, with <em>9to5Google</em> reporting the earbuds sometimes fail to register that all-important third tap.</p><div id=\"k8xADe\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Alexa, play \"Nothing Else Matters\"<br><br>Yeah, it's time to say hey to Google and Siri.<br><br>Voice Assistance is now available for your ear (1).</p>— Nothing (@nothing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1490692745995988994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 7, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"262XSP\">Since their original release last year, the Nothing Ear 1’s have received a number of firmware updates, as well as a new black color scheme. In a review from December last year<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.inputmag.com/reviews/nothing-ear-1-black-edition-review-fixed-bugs\"><em>InputMag </em>noted</a> that these updates appeared to have fixed many of the issues the earbuds originally had, which included noise cancellation dropouts and connection bugs. Now, we can add voice assistant support to this list.</p>",
