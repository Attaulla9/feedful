Based on the trailer, the plot is vaguely about them reuniting after a few decades and teaming up to save the world.</p><div id=\"5WeDvn\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dK1CuXG7GMQ?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"4nYkUf\">Disney does a lot of lampshading in the trailer and in its Twitter post about how this movie <em>totally</em> isn't a reboot — Chip even shouts “nobody wants a reboot!” But while that argument may hold water for the Disney Plus show <em>Chip n’ Dale: Park Life, </em>which seems <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLdY__1EKic\">very much aimed at young children</a>, the movie is clearly meant for people who remember the Rescue Rangers show. The trailer starts off with a bit of a <em>BoJack Horseman</em> vibe, showing a “news package” about the duo’s downfall 30 years after their rise to fame. There’s a joke that Dale looks different after getting “CGI surgery.”</p><div id=\"3HXpRM\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It's not a reboot.

There’s also an extended gag about bad CGI animation — including a reference to the horrifying <em>Cats</em> movie from 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/El0HZZvaW2Z32msWcHrVq4weETc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23250033/Screen_Shot_2022_02_16_at_10.10.00.png\">      <cite>Image: Disney</cite>      <figcaption><em>The references, they are not subtle.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"O2P1Pq\"><em>Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers</em> will come to Disney Plus on May 20th.
