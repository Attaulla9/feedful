So far, the upcoming device appears to share several similarities with its Pixel 6 predecessor, including the same prominent camera bar on the rear of the phone.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FG1z65NKOnWSxwKa4QxGjb68zzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23266700/pixel_7_pro_2.jpeg\">      <cite>Image by OnLeaks via SmartPrix</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Pixel 7 Pro has a hole-punch selfie camera.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"oyF55N\">The three cameras on the back of the supposed Pixel 7 Pro look oddly large (but just might appear that way in this particular render) and may include a wide-angle camera, periscope telephoto camera, and an ultra-wide camera. On the front of the device, a hole-punch selfie camera sits at the top of its apparent OLED display.</p><p id=\"P4XEg6\">As <em>SmartPrix</em> notes, the device features the same curved edges as the Pixel 6 Pro. However, the Pixel 7 Pro is slightly shorter lengthwise and also a tiny bit wider and thicker at 163 x 76.6 x 8.7mm (or 6.4 x 3 x 0.34in) as opposed to the Pixel 6 Pro’s 163.9 x 75.9 x 8.9mm (6.45 x 2.99 x 0.35in) size. <em>9to5Google</em> points out the absence of the plastic strip that houses the mmWave antenna at the top of some Pixel 6 devices; it looks like Google swapped this for a mmWave window on the side of the device instead.</p><p id=\"MKkAzx\">As well as the Pixel 7 Pro, OnLeaks has also released <a href=\"https://www.carhp.com/news/exclusive-google-pixel-7-leaked-february-2022-design-camera-dimensions\">renders of what the regular Pixel 7 might look like</a>. The Pixel 7 has a similar design to the Pixel 7 Pro, but with one fewer rear camera and a smaller display.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzF0ONq4xZVlpwpUzB03ucC-LeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23267624/ac348437f9dd18bc18396c417726f4fe.jpg\">      <cite>Image: OnLeaks via Carhp</cite>      <figcaption><em>The non-Pro Pixel 7.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"Oj9Rc0\">Based on these renders, it looks like Google isn’t veering far from the design of the Pixel 6, for better or worse. In our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review\">review of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</a>, my colleague Dan Seifert’s biggest complaint was the bulkiness of each device, and disappointingly enough, any changes in terms of size appear to be minimal. We saw leaked renders of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/20/22793079/google-pixel-6a-leak-compact-mobile-no-headphone-jack\">the more compact Pixel 6A in November</a>, which Google appeared to confirm the name of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22906019/pixel-6a-coloring-book-leak\">in a Google-branded coloring book</a>. There hasn’t been any confirmation from Google on either the Pixel 7 or Pixel 6A — the company likely won’t release the Pixel 7 until the fall (when it typically releases new phones), while the Pixel 6A will probably arrive a bit earlier.</p><p id=\"gyOEQe\"><em><strong>Update February 24th, 4:11AM ET:</strong></em><em> Updated with details of the non-Pro Pixel 7.</em></p>",
