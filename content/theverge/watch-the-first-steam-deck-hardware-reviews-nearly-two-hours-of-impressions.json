Both GamersNexus and The Phawx were able to drain it dry in just 1.5 hours playing <em>Devil May Cry 5</em> and <em>Control, </em>respectively, on higher settings without VSync, and neither of them was able to reach Valve’s suggested eight hours of light play / remote play no matter what they did. </p><p id=\"loriQb\">A few other assorted battery life tests:</p><ul><li id=\"wRlNWF\">2 hours of Devil May Cry 5 at high settings with VSync (GamersNexus)</li><li id=\"rwLjBf\">3 hours of VLC 4K 60fps playback at 50 percent brightness (GamersNexus)</li><li id=\"Xwk0M3\">6 hours of <em>Dead Cells </em>at 50 percent brightness (The Phawx, GamersNexus)</li><li id=\"W1mKIo\">6 hours of Steam Link streaming at 50 percent brightness (GamersNexus)</li><li id=\"kOi49h\">5 hours and 40 minutes of <em>Portal 2</em> capped to 30fps (The Phawx)</li><li id=\"PQHNKM\">4 hours of Forza 5 capped to 30fps (The Phawx)</li><li id=\"2ADMr6\">3 hours and 21 minutes of <em>Ghostrunner</em> capped to 30fps (LTT)</li></ul><p id=\"PlDcvN\">In general, The Phawx says “it’s pretty easy to get four hours” with the Steam Deck, but only if you’re running games at 30Hz, half the screen’s refresh rate. I might be OK with that in a bunch of titles, but a racing game like <em>Forza</em>? Ehhh. <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=RADV-Dynamic-VRS\">Valve is still working on possible power-saving techniques</a>, however.</p><div id=\"ozs9jx\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxKd0nr6uYw?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"QfFMPW\">The flip side of battery life is performance, though, and there, everyone seems just as impressed as I was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview\">in my original hands-on</a>. So far, the Steam Deck seems to totally outrun other recent portable PCs like the latest Aya Neo and the GPD Win 3, and you don’t have to take anyone’s word for that: The Phawx includes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxKd0nr6uYw&amp;t=1416s\">10 straight minutes of side-by-side footage</a> with full performance stats so you can see for yourself. </p><p id=\"pil6dN\">For ergonomics and other creature comforts, I’d suggest taking a look at the Linus Tech Tips video, where he praises the joysticks, speakers, and screen (including an array of brightness modes, including a nice dim one for night) but pans the rumble. “At the moment, haptics on this device are a poo stain on an otherwise crisp white sheet,” he says. </p><div id=\"DWVy4r\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjZ4POvk14c?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"oiUwtH\">Intriguingly, The Phawx says the Steam Deck gives you quite a bit of leeway to tweak <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit\">the Aerith chip’s</a> settings, including parking some of the CPU cores if you want — and that by disabling two cores, he was able to see a 20 percent performance boost in an early scene in <em>Control</em>. Tweaking to get the most out of a handheld PC isn’t unusual, and you shouldn’t need to with the Deck, but it’ll be interesting to see if the community figures out some best practices.</p><p id=\"jmQhyy\">Does all this leave you wondering when <em>The Verge</em> will weigh in?
