As pointed out by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeJMika/status/1491868034704687109\">Mike Mika on Twitter</a>, rather than the hi-tech instrument you might expect, the prop held by actor David Pasquesi appears to be a tabletop <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/handheld-video-game-coleco-bowlatronic-coleco/GwHhfvmpxyTv0w?hl=en\">Coleco Bowlaltronic toy</a> from the 1980s. </p><p id=\"8yZw7E\"><em>Boba Fett</em> thus continues Star Wars’ proud tradition of repurposing ordinary household objects as sci-fi gadgets in its galaxy far, far away. Perhaps the most famous example crops up in <em>Episode V,</em> when an extra can be seen in the background of Cloud City carrying what appears to be a household ice cream maker. This being Star Wars, the background character eventually received an <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Willrow_Hood/Legends\">entire backstory</a>, while the prop itself has now been inducted into Star Wars canon as a <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Camtono\">camtono security container</a>. </p><div id=\"Np82sz\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Had I not just BOUGHT a Coleco Bowlatronic, I wouldn't have had my Leonardo DiCaprio moment watching Book of Boba Fett. <a href=\"https://t.co/oH9ILJF12m\">pic.twitter.com/oH9ILJF12m</a></p>— Mike Mika (@MikeJMika) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeJMika/status/1491868034704687109?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 10, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"mq90jm\">Oh, and did I mention that some fans like to run through Star Wars Celebration <a href=\"https://twitter.com/missingwords/status/589260953100767232\">carrying their own ice cream makers</a> in tribute to the character? <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/running-of-the-hoods-star-wars-celebration/\">Because they do</a>.</p><p id=\"MZ0dnv\">There are numerous examples like this from across Star Wars. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BostonDynamics/status/1476329434680541185\">Boston Dynamics’ Spot robots</a> as well as a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Thatsabooklight/comments/se3l9t/this_tool_in_the_book_of_boba_fett_is_the_same/\">simple torch</a> appeared in an earlier episode of <em>Boba Fett</em>, while Liam Neeson’s Qui-Gon Jinn used what appeared to be a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Thatsabooklight/comments/awu0o8/quigon_jinns_communicator_was_a_gillette_razor/\">Gillette razor as a communicator device</a> in <em>Episode I</em>. For a look at the components that go into more unique props like Han Solo’s famous blaster, I thoroughly recommend this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4sCReGjfZ_A\">old video from Tested.com</a>.</p><p id=\"J1eZsN\">It just goes to show how other-worldly ordinary items can appear with the smallest of tweaks and when placed in the hands of a capable actor. </p>",
