Across social media, users have complained that trying to access work-related chatrooms meets long load times, the inability to view threads, and issues when trying to send a message to colleagues.</p><p id=\"mAAnzJ\">The Slack Status Twitter account has since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SlackStatus/status/1496133874262368264\">acknowledged</a> issues loading the platform. “Some customer[s] may be experiencing issues with loading Slack,” Slack writes. “We’ll provide a status update once we have more information. We’re sorry for the disruption.” A follow-up says things are improving, and suggests users reload the app if they haven’t reconnected yet. Here at <em>The Verge</em>, more of us can connect to Slack again, with scattered issues still affecting some people and platforms.</p><div id=\"X9xdPg\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We're seeing signs of improvement. Please try reloading Slack, and if not a cache reset. We’re still monitoring the situation. We’ll confirm once this issue is fully resolved. <a href=\"https://t.co/rd7foR3W8N\">https://t.co/rd7foR3W8N</a></p>— Slack Status (@SlackStatus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SlackStatus/status/1496169740561117185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"1i2CIK\"><a href=\"https://status.slack.com/2022-02/3083852db30af86f\">Slack’s status page</a> says the platform “is not loading for some users,” and indicates problems started around 9:25AM ET. </p><blockquote><p id=\"UuW0gz\">We’re investigating the issue where Slack is not loading for some users.

Last year <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213105/slack-outage-down-2021-server-error\">problems struck on January 4th</a>, cutting off people trying to connect to work remotely. Now more workers are back in offices, but clearly, demand for Slack’s service is still high. We’ll update this post again when there’s more information available, or once <em>The Verge</em> team (and every other newsroom full of writers that are suddenly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/14/6975545/slack-is-down-and-we-are-all-alone\">all alone again</a>) has figured out how to use threading in Discord.</p><p id=\"hTAUSl\"><em><strong>Update February 22nd, 10:17AM ET:</strong></em><em> Added latest update from Slack.</em></p><p id=\"eyH93M\"><em><strong>Update February 22nd 10:47AM ET</strong></em><em>: Added latest update from Slack and a statement from a Slack spokesperson.</em></p><p id=\"TKmT7G\"><em><strong>Update February 22nd 12:10PM ET</strong></em><em>: Added latest update from Slack.</em></p>",
