It’s called the Awesome Galaxy A Event on the invite, and it’s dedicated to the phonemaker’s midrange A-series devices, in case you couldn’t tell.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"YS1VZv\"><q>The Galaxy A73 and A53 may both come with 5G</q></aside></div><p id=\"vUhWf7\">It’s rumored that Samsung will add two new phones to the lineup: the Galaxy A73 and A53. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334392/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-a72-specs-price-camera\">Samsung announced the Galaxy A72 and A52</a> at an Unpacked event held around the same time. Both phones are due for a refresh, and it’s likely that we just might get our first glimpse at this month’s event.</p><p id=\"OCXwcw\">Rumors and leaks indicate the Galaxy A73 and A53 may both come with 5G, which would be an upgrade for the A72, at least, since the A52 already has a 5G variation. The <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-a73-leak-tips-5g-camera-upgrade/\">A73 is expected</a> to come with the same 6.7-inch display, along with a Snapdragon 750G chip, while the A53 may sport a 6.5-inch paired with Samsung’s in-house Exynos 1200 system on a chip (SoC).</p><p id=\"R4u46f\">You can catch the March 17th Awesome Galaxy A event when it goes live on <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/\">Samsung’s website</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/samsung\">YouTube channel</a>.</p>",
