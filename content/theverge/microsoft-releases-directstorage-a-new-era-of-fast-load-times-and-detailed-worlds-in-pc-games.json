The so-called “DirectStorage API” would let games load more detailed worlds, and load them more quickly than before. </p><p id=\"X6YwOH\">Now, Microsoft says the DirectStorage API has arrived. “Starting today, Windows games can ship with DirectStorage. This public SDK release begins a new era of fast load times and detailed worlds in PC games by allowing developers to more fully utilize the speed of the latest storage devices,” <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-api-available-on-pc/\">reads the company’s blog post</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"DirectStorage reads from NVMe SSD to RAM, copies to GPU memory, then decompresses on the GPU.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NQg0YN0IqmtaRBvQZ6J20pgFkhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23316288/BnyXcM5g4Tok5sydJjZrmC_2560_80.png\">      <cite>Image: Microsoft</cite>      <figcaption><em>How DirectStorage works, in a nutshell. </em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"4jOWk4\">More good news: it’ll work with Windows 10, not just Windows 11, even though Microsoft says that 11 is “our recommended path for gaming.”</p><p id=\"zvWDUb\">Before you rush out to find a game to finally take full advantage of that speedy NVMe 4.0 stick drive and compatible motherboard, though, you should know the games aren’t available yet. While developers <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-developer-preview-now-available/\">have been able to preview the tech since July</a>, today’s just a starting gun for many who might dig in. In fact, the real starting gun might not be <a href=\"https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/breaking-down-the-world-of-athia-the-technologies-of-forspoken-presented-by-amd/886052\">till March 23rd at the Game Developers Conference</a>, when AMD and developer Luminous Productions will explain how they brought DirectStorage to <em>Forspoken</em>, one of the first showcase games for the tech. It’ll be October 11th before you can try <em>Forspoken</em>, by the way, since that game <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1500863854359846913\">got delayed just last week</a>.</p><div id=\"Zuk7aC\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A message from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Forspoken?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Forspoken</a> Development Team. <a href=\"https://t.co/T302V6h4Np\">pic.twitter.com/T302V6h4Np</a></p>— Forspoken (@Forspoken) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1500863854359846913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"nXsxjD\">You might also have some understandable doubts that developers will really take full advantage of NVMe storage all that quickly, considering that many PC gamers still haven’t moved to fast NVMe SSDs, and because games that talked up SSD like <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart </em>on the PS5 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22608153/ps5-ssd-speed-test-storage-expansion-m2-playstation-5\">were found to be taking somewhat less than full advantage</a> of their capabilities. (Heck, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review\">the Steam Deck</a> means that some games developers will still need to target UHS-I microSD cards that might read at under 100MB/sec, rather than the 4,000-7,000MB/sec of a PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD.)</p><p id=\"q4ZHZO\">Still, if Windows games can theoretically pull the same SSD tricks as the PS5 and Xbox Series X, that means there’s one less piece of the PC dragging down the potential of next-gen gaming — and we’re eager for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage\">that largely unrealized potential</a> to finally be fulfilled. </p><p id=\"RsGEKM\">Here’s the latest gameplay trailer for <em>Forspoken</em>, as it might run on a Sony PS5, but also on a Windows PC and the Xbox Series X using fast SSD techniques:</p><div id=\"e4ugSm\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8f8QZTOrfk?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"cU4cMq\"> You love to see the rising tide raise all the boats. </p><aside id=\"iZtbky\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The next generation of gaming didn’t actually arrive with Xbox Series X and PS5\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage\"}]}'></div></aside>",
