When scanned, the code brought viewers to Coinbase’s promotional website, offering a limited time promotion of $15 worth of free Bitcoin to new sign ups, along with a $3 million giveaway that customers can enter. </p><p id=\"5gMhf9\">The offer is a limited time one, with new customers having until February 15th to get the $15 promotion — something that may be an issue, as Coinbase’s app is currently down, presumably due to the massive influx of traffic from the clever ad. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RzOMfEPoe0m8-pl72781-KTsSbM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23239755/Image_from_iOS.png\">  </figure><p id=\"VDI1Vy\">Cryptocurrency companies are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/business/media/super-bowl-commercials.html\">a major presence at this year’s Super Bowl</a>, with multiple companies — including Crypto.com and FTX — using the big game to promote either cryptocurrency exchanges, NFTs, or other related projects. </p>",
