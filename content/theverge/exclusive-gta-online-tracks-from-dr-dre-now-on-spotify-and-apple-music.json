As well as Dre himself, the tracks include appearances from guest artists like Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Anderson .Paak, Busta Rhymes, Nipsey Hussle, and Ty Dolla $ign.  </p><p id=\"i5MHmB\"><em>GTA</em> is part of a growing list of games that have debuted new music. Guns n’ Roses <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/new-guns-n-roses-song-premiering-on-rock-band-2-183122/\">premiered the song “Shackler’s Revenge” in <em>Rock Band 2</em></a> in 2008, and Weezer included four unreleased songs from its <em>Black Album</em> in a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245926/fortnite-weezer-black-album-collaboration-creative-mode\">custom map in <em>Fortnite</em> in 2019</a>. But Dre’s collaboration with <em>GTA Online</em> was a little more interesting. The rapper actually appeared in the game itself, and a key storyline involved recovering a stolen phone with the new music on it. </p><div id=\"aaPR61\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Partner with Franklin Clinton and friends in The Contract, an all-new adventure for GTA Online.<br><br>Fix the kinds of problems plaguing Los Santos high rollers, including helping your A-list client Dr. Dre resolve a high-stakes theft.<a href=\"https://t.co/2D0Z7wcRZv\">https://t.co/2D0Z7wcRZv</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/LEDOXDtTcX\">pic.twitter.com/LEDOXDtTcX</a></p>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1471118190994497542?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 15, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"1l38hw\">Although the music integration sounds cool, reviews of the update itself were a little more mixed. “While <em>GTA Online</em> is set in the present,” <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/gta-online-s-dr-dre-update-is-good-but-the-old-jank-s-1848228326\"><em>Kotaku </em>wrote</a>, “It’s still very much an aging game with some very frustrating problems that befit its near decade-old status.” Hopefully the imminent arrival of the game on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917783/rocstar-games-gta6-active-development-gta5-ps5-xbox-series-x-patch\">current-gen consoles next month</a> will help freshen up the experience.</p>",
