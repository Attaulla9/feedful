All that data gets posted on the <a href=\"https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/\">UK government’s gender pay gap database</a>, where you’re free to search for companies and find out how much lower women get paid when compared to men (or vice versa).</p><div id=\"erHAln\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In this organisation, women's median hourly pay is 32.8% lower than men's. <a href=\"https://t.co/MA2R4Qs5iI\">https://t.co/MA2R4Qs5iI</a></p>— Gender Pay Gap Bot (@PayGapApp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PayGapApp/status/1501183843734364162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"olr6MN\">The Gender Pay Gap Bot is exposing just how wide pay gaps are (if any at all). And yes, the bot’s data is accurate. (I double-checked several of its tweets, and it all matches up with the information on the UK’s website.) It looks like some companies aren’t too keen on facing the reality of things, however, as the bot already led a number of organizations to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmberFirefly/status/1501136833790582785?s=20&amp;t=k4bY3OQwPwtb3YLxMrP9Dw\">delete their original tweets</a>.</p><p id=\"GwDP49\">If you have some free time — and even if you aren’t based in the UK — take a scroll through the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PayGapApp\">Gender Pay Gap Bot’s timeline</a> today. It’s posting a new roast every couple of minutes.</p>",
