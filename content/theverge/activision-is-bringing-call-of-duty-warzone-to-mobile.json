Activision also hasn’t specified if the game will be like <em>Apex Legends Mobile</em>, which only lets you play <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947472/apex-legends-mobile-limited-regional-launch-10-countries\">against other mobile players</a>, or the mobile version of <em>Fortnite</em>, which <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/how-to-enable-cross-platform-fortnite-matches/\">can do cross-platform play</a>. Activision declined to comment further. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"46yLNc\"><q>Mobile ports of hit shooters can be incredibly lucrative</q></aside></div><p id=\"x5miy3\">Mobile ports of hit shooters can be incredibly lucrative, as Activision knows from its own <em>Call of Duty: Mobile — </em>that game, developed in partnership with Tencent-owned TiMi Studios, has surpassed an astonishing $1.5 billion in global lifetime player spending since its 2019 launch, <a href=\"https://sensortower.com/blog/call-of-duty-mobile-shoots-past-usd1-5-billion-in-lifetime-player-spending/\">according to Sensor Tower</a>. With a mobile <em>Warzone</em>, perhaps Activision is betting that it can make lightning strike twice.</p><p id=\"j2PbL0\">It seems like there’s potential for another winner; the company will be leveraging the already popular <em>Warzone</em> franchise, and other mobile shooters like <em>PUBG: Mobile</em> and <em>Garena Free Fire</em> are among <a href=\"https://sensortower.com/blog/top-mobile-games-worldwide-january-2022-by-downloads/\">the most popular mobile games around</a>. Though with mobile ports of games like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games\">Riot Games’ <em>Valorant</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396717/ea-battlefield-mobile-smartphones-tablets-2022\">EA’s <em>Battlefield</em></a> on the way, too, a mobile <em>Warzone</em> will be entering an increasingly competitive field.</p><p id=\"4kYSjN\">This new mobile <em>Warzone</em> arrives as Activision is making some changes to the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise. The publisher is working on a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/11/22929492/call-of-duty-warzone-sequel-new-experience-infinity-ward\">“new <em>Warzone</em> experience”</a> that’s set to be released this year and is reportedly delaying the mainline <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/22/22946505/call-of-duty-2023-delayed-annual-release-activision-blizzard\">2023 <em>Call of Duty</em> title</a>. Activision is also under the spotlight due to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay\">lawsuits</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch\">its impending acquisition by Microsoft</a>. </p><p id=\"CL9xWJ\"></p>",
