The company has reportedly been working on the phone for over a year, and Pei is said to have shown off a prototype to executives from companies including Qualcomm at this week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. </p><p id=\"zXYNPq\">An April launch would come a little under a year after the company released its debut product, a pair of wireless earbuds called the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs\">Ear 1</a>. The phone will reportedly contain similar design elements to the earbuds, such as using transparent components, although other details on the new device are limited. <em>TechCrunch</em> cites a source with direct knowledge of the company’s plans.</p><div id=\"oOiB37\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We've got a lot to catch up on Carl  </p>— Android (@Android) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Android/status/1493730251167309829?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"xtLd0A\">Pei has always been clear that he expects Nothing to expand into more product categories over time. In an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices\">interview with <em>The Verge</em></a><em> </em>last January, Pei said that the plan was to eventually offer an ecosystem of different devices, and the following month, Nothing bought the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284363/nothing-company-essential-brand-acquisition-news\">rights to the Essential brand</a>, which released a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16165040/essential-phone-review-android-andy-rubin\">single Android smartphone in 2017</a> before shutting down <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134985/essential-phone-shutting-down-andy-rubin-startup\">less than three years later</a>. Last November, a company executive in India said Nothing had <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/exclusive-as-nothing-completes-one-year-brand-now-gearing-to-launch-over-5-new-products-1872864-2021-11-03\">five new products in development</a>.</p><p id=\"h0Ly8v\">More recently, Pei appears to have been teasing some kind of Android announcement. On February 15th, the executive tweeted that he was “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1493664344365846539\">Back on Android</a>,” only for the brand accounts for both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Android/status/1493730251167309829\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snapdragon/status/1493750050580795392\">Snapdragon</a> to post similarly cryptic teases in response. Even the official brand account for Nothing has teased that “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1498306905764245506\">March is going to be fun.</a>”</p><div id=\"LDlCBS\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">March is going to be fun.</p>— Nothing (@nothing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nothing/status/1498306905764245506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 28, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"cUtUiR\">A representative from Nothing did not immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment on<em> TechCrunch</em>’s report.</p>",
