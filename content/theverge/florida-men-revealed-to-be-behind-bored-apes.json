Solano is a 32-year-old writer and editor behind the pseudonym Gargamel, while the 35-year-old Aronow goes by Gordon Goner.</p><div id=\"wJoRAU\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Got doxxed against my will. Oh well.<br><br>Web2 me vs. Web3 me <a href=\"https://t.co/uLkpsJ5LvN\">pic.twitter.com/uLkpsJ5LvN</a></p>— GordonGoner.eth (@GordonGoner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GordonGoner/status/1489764541084930048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 5, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"D95Stb\">After <em>BuzzFeed</em>’s article was posted, the two later responded to the situation with the “Web2 me vs. Web3 me” meme on Twitter, in which you essentially compare a photo of yourself in the real world with an NFT or avatar that’s supposed to represent you in the metaverse. Both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GordonGoner/status/1489764541084930048\">Aronow</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CryptoGarga/status/1489768443771596800\">Solano</a> compare pictures of themselves with Bored Ape NFTs and say they’ve been doxxed.</p><p id=\"SpVTP4\"><em>BuzzFeed</em> says it found Solano and Aronow’s information by searching public business records for Yuga Labs, the company behind the BAYC. It discovered that Yuga Labs had an address affiliated with Solano and then uncovered other public records that connected Solano with Aronow. Nicole Muniz, the CEO of Yuga Labs confirmed to <em>BuzzFeed</em> that Solano and Aronow are, indeed, the cofounders’ true identities.</p><div id=\"n3aVuB\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Got doxed so why not. Web2 me vs Web3 me. <a href=\"https://t.co/jfmzo5NtrH\">pic.twitter.com/jfmzo5NtrH</a></p>— Garga.eth (@CryptoGarga) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CryptoGarga/status/1489768443771596800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 5, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"4PAu7m\"><em>BuzzFeed</em> even dug up some old information on the web about the two, including <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-prj-clare-oconnor-wylie-aronow-reader-of-the-week-20141113-story.html\">Aronow’s “Readers of the Week”</a> interview with the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> and <a href=\"https://www.zyzzyva.org/contributor/greg-solano/\">Solano’s critique</a> of various pieces of literature. Interviews with outlets, like <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/bayc-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-interview-1250461/\"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/why-bored-ape-avatars-are-taking-over-twitter\"><em>New Yorker</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/01/the-bored-apes-founders-havent-yet-joined-the-yacht-club/\"><em>CoinDesk</em></a>, help connect the dots between the duo’s online personas and real-life stories, corroborating what we now know about them. The two met while growing up in Florida and dreamed up the idea of the BAYC in hopes of breaking into the world of cryptocurrency.</p><p id=\"cnH9OO\">In case you’re wondering, Aronow and Solano aren’t the ones who actually <em>drew </em>the, well, very interesting-looking and sometimes fashionable anthropomorphic apes. A <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/seneca-bored-ape-yacht-club-digital-art-nfts-1280341/\">27-year-old who goes by the name Seneca</a> was the lead artist for the original Bored Apes collection and is credited with creating the apes’ base design. There are also two BAYC cofounders who remain unidentified — a couple of programmers who go by the names No Sass and Emperor Tomato Ketchup.</p><p id=\"jx0sSs\">I don’t know what I was expecting, but I guess the BAYC identity reveal was all a bit less climactic than I hoped. But considering that the BAYC has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664469/bored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount\">sold off millions of dollars worth of ape artwork</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22843104/adidas-nfts-metaverse-sold-bored-ape\">partnering with companies like Adidas</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/22904893/nft-explainer-why-celebrities-buy-bored-ape-yacht-club-jimmy-fallon-paris-hilton\">has had numerous celebrities</a> — including Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon — buy their NFTs, anticlimatic is probably a good thing.</p><aside id=\"aQ1jmu\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Two NFT copycats are fighting over which is the real fake Bored Ape Yacht Club \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860010/bored-ape-yacht-club-payc-phayc-copycat-nft\"},{\"title\":\"How to sneak into a Bored Ape Yacht Club party\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22824387/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-party-new-york\"}]}'></div></aside>",
