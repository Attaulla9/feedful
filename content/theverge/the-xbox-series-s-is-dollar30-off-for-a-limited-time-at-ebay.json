Reputable eBay seller Antonline is offering two options: the standard <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F125130710386%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDealsXboxSeriesS021622%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F16%2F22937672%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-series-s-console-restock-availability-antonline-ebay-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Series S console</a> and the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F294791849968%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDealsXboxSeriesS021622%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F16%2F22937672%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-series-s-console-restock-availability-antonline-ebay-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Series S <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket League</em> Bundle</a>. Both packages get you the console and a matching white controller for that nice $269.99 price, but the <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket League</em> bundle includes extra in-game content for both free-to-play titles. If you’re hesitant about eBay purchases, Antonline maintains a 98.8 percent positive feedback score on its eBay store and offers a 30-day money-back return policy.</p><p id=\"7LaCKv\">While the Series S may be the lesser of the two Xbox consoles in terms of features and power, lacking a disc drive, and topping out at 1440p for games while the Series X renders games in 4K, it can play all the same digital titles. Just be aware that the 512GB of storage may feel a little slim if you’re into big, 100GB-plus games like <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>. Though, we’re always on the lookout for sales on storage for you, including ones that are compatible with Xbox consoles, so feel free to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters\">subscribe to the <em>Verge Deals</em> newsletter</a> for twice-a-week deals right to your inbox.</p><aside id=\"CVmOII\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Cyberpunk 2077’s next-gen update now available for PS5 and Xbox Series X / S\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/15/22933552/cyberpunk-2077-next-gen-update-patch-ps5-xbox-series-x\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"TUF4TQ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11012347\"></div></div><div id=\"4RcbAC\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9444105\"></div></div><p id=\"v5Wwhi\">Modern consoles like the Xbox Series X and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22777072/sony-ps5-playstation-5-console-where-how-to-buy-tips-restock\">PlayStation 5</a> have been <em>very</em> difficult to get a hold of for well over a year now. And the frequency of console restocks ebbs and flows at random, adding another challenge to snagging one. Availability increased around the holidays, but now we’re in a dry spell. But at least for the little Xbox Series S, it’s great to see that we’re at the point where discounts are becoming common — and getting better every month. Maybe one day in our lifetimes we’ll even see deals on the Series X and PS5.</p><aside id=\"Ti4331\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
