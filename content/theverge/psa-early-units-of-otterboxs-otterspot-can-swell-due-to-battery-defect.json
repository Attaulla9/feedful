The company currently offers a bundle containing <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/otterspot/wireless-charging-system/otr54-system.html#q=otterspot&amp;lang=default&amp;start=1\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a 36W charging base with one battery</a>, but the base can simultaneously charge up to two stackable batteries, plus a Qi-compatible device on top. </p><p id=\"5wvdHI\">OtterBox spokesperson Julie Campagnoli shared with <em>The Verge</em> that this issue impacts units that were manufactured during the first two months of production, between July through August 2019. No injuries have been reported as of yet.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAFgWZrhkYBZrdl5_8mlXCFo1Mw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19084620/stacks_consumer_baseplustwo_b_exp.jpg\">  </figure></div><p id=\"kNDveb\">Regardless of when you may have purchased the OtterSpot, it’s a good idea to check the serial number on the bottom of each battery.
