Daft Punk also announced a 25th anniversary vinyl reissue of the album, and after the concert ended, posted that the reissue is available <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daftpunk/status/1496271362410926080\">on streaming services, too</a>.</p><div id=\"ZREJNm\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Homework 25th anniversary edition available<a href=\"https://t.co/WzMEqOwxrM\">https://t.co/WzMEqOwxrM</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ViLxDZFgBF\">pic.twitter.com/ViLxDZFgBF</a></p>— Daft Punk (@daftpunk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daftpunk/status/1496271362410926080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"FnikWb\">While it’s unclear if this is the beginning of more from Daft Punk, you might want to follow the group’s accounts on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daftpunk\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/daftpunk/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_kRDKYrUlrbtrSiyu5Tflg\">YouTube</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/daftpunk\">Facebook</a> just in case.
