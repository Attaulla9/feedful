The new trailer features some of his space ranger compatriots — voiced by Keke Palmer, Dale Soules, and Taika Waititi — along with Sox, a creepy robotic feline played by Peter Sohn.</p><p id=\"8dJY3h\">Now, the entire premise of <em>Lightyear</em> is a little confusing, and in a statement, director Angus MacLane tried to clear things up. “In <em>Toy Story</em> there seemed to be this incredible backstory to him being a Space Ranger that’s only touched upon, and I always wanted to explore that world further,” he explains. “So my <em>Lighytear</em> pitch was, ‘What was the movie that Andy saw that made him want a Buzz Lightyear toy?’ I wanted to see that movie. And now I’m lucky enough to get to make it.”</p><p id=\"OfW8PW\">If that doesn’t clear things up, you’ll have to wait until the movie releases on June 17th.</p><p id=\"CjYARN\"></p><p id=\"OF62ei\"></p>",
