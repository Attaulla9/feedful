Porsche estimates that 1,100 of its vehicles are on board the Felicity Ace, a cargo ship about the size of three football fields. Volkswagen Group is also home to brands like Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, and VW. </p><p id=\"NinGoo\">The Felicity Ace was heading from Germany to a port in Rhode Island when it <a href=\"https://www.fleetmon.com/maritime-news/2022/37269/mol-car-carrier-fire-abandoned-atlantic/\">issued distress signals</a> Wednesday morning, reporting a fire in one of its cargo decks.
