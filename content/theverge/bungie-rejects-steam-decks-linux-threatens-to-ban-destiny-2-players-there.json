It’s looking like the answer is never — because <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo\">the soon-to-be Sony subsidiary</a> has published a help page that not only says the game’s unsupported, but outright <em>threatens to ban </em>prospective Steam Deck players (via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1498797300985987074\">Wario64</a>). </p><p id=\"DEb3m5\"><a href=\"https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049024592-Destiny-2-Steam-Guide\">The help page</a> has a new section titled “Steam Deck and Destiny 2,” which reads:</p><blockquote><p id=\"bjrOgu\">Destiny 2 is not supported for play on the Steam Deck or on any system utilizing Steam Play’s Proton unless Windows is installed and running. Players who attempt to launch Destiny 2 on the Steam Deck through SteamOS or Proton will be unable to enter the game and will be returned to their game library after a short time.</p><p id=\"7i6ge8\">Players who attempt to bypass Destiny 2 incompatibility will be met with a game ban.</p></blockquote>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0_3mDs1ZpYhWCrq3zsrVdFC17pc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23281298/steam_deck_destiny_2.jpg\">      <cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The image, for posterity<span class=\"ql-cursor\">﻿</span></em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"rHicyp\">We’ve been asking Bungie <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709918/valve-steam-deck-supported-games-anti-cheat-proton-eac-battleye-epic\">for five months</a> whether it might support the Steam Deck and Linux more generally, which seemed like a reasonable ask for several reasons:</p><ul><li id=\"aLinCL\"><em>Destiny 2</em> is one of the more forgiving shooters in terms of controls, playing well on both console and PC</li><li id=\"PtZ9Ql\"><em>Destiny 2 </em>was <a href=\"https://www.battleye.com/\">known to use</a> the BattlEye anti-cheat software, and enabling that for the Steam Deck <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22737127/valve-steam-deck-battleye-anti-cheat-pubg-dayz-r6-siege\">is as easy as sending an email, according to Valve</a></li><li id=\"0r8Qkm\"><em>Destiny 2</em> already runs on Linux — Bungie had to port it to Google Stadia, which is a Linux-based platform. Admittedly, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel\">it doesn’t look its best on Stadia</a>, but it’s quite playable</li></ul><p id=\"GgdTgL\">I was looking forward to playing it that way. But the last communication we got from Bungie about Steam Deck and Proton <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709918/valve-steam-deck-supported-games-anti-cheat-proton-eac-battleye-epic\">was on October 3rd</a>, and it contained no answers. Now, it appears the answer is “we only run on Windows”.</p><p id=\"71fnvL\">To be fair, Bungie isn’t the only one to reject the Steam Deck without necessarily providing a satisfying explanation — Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney explained to me <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney\">why <em>Fortnite</em> won’t get updated for the Steam Deck</a> last month, <em>even though Epic’s own Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) </em>claims game developers can enable it with “just a few clicks.” </p><p id=\"HlKpYY\">And while there is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937525/steam-deck-proton-linux-persona-4-golden-monster-hunter-rise-forza-horizon-5\">one hint that EA’s rival <em>Apex Legends</em> might come to the Deck</a>, and <em>Elden Ring</em> does work on Deck (including online modes) despite generally using anti-cheat, it’s also true that many other top multiplayer games have yet to fully arrive.</p><p id=\"XuPHZc\">Bungie and Valve didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><p id=\"llfuTX\">I did get <em>Destiny 2 </em>running via Stadia on the Deck. You can see a teensy bit of it in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w64KhTguWA\">my video review</a>.</p><div id=\"h11sv5\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Steam Deck|106078\" data-volume-uuid=\"fef96bfb9\" data-volume-id=\"106078\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-749\" class=\"volume-video\" data-volume-player-choice=\"youtube\"></div></div>",
