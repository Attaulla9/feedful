It punishes people with fines or up to 15 years behind bars for spreading “false information” about Russia’s military or for publicly calling for sanctions on Russia. As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, it has begun to crack down on social platforms and foreign media — Russia has put a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22960739/russia-internet-block-facebook-meta-roskomnadzor-ukraine\">block on Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22952006/russia-block-twitter-ukraine-invasion-censorship-putin\">restricted access to Twitter</a>, and has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22961286/bbc-news-blocked-in-russia-ukraine-invasion-shortwave-radio\">barred access to BBC news sites</a>.</p><p id=\"svix4a\">Last week, Russia’s communications agency Roskomnadzor <a href=\"https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news74152.htm\">called out TikTok</a> for removing state-backed content from its platform. TikTok later announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22962289/tiktok-misinformation-state-media-labels-rollout-russia-ukraine\">add labels to “some” state-controlled media</a>, and has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-02-28/card/tiktok-joins-meta-platforms-in-restricting-access-to-russian-state-media-i2Nwf5dBN3Noz0zhXK14\">reportedly been making it harder</a> for users to access Russian state media, in line with moves from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22955542/facebook-meta-blocks-rt-sputnik-eu-instagram\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22956114/youtube-blocks-russian-media-rt-russia-today-sputnik-europe\">YouTube</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22959636/spotify-removes-rt-sputnik-russia-kremlin-ukraine-conflict\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22957443/roku-directv-russia-ukraine-rt\">others</a>.</p><p id=\"2IxwNX\">“We will continue to evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services with safety as our top priority,” TikTok notes.</p>",
