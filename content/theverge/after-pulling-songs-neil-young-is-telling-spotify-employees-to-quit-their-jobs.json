This comes after Young <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22903354/spotify-joe-rogan-removing-neil-young-music\">pulled his music from Spotify</a>, claiming the company was “spreading fake information about vaccines” through Joe Rogan’s podcast. </p><p id=\"9Aqen4\">Young’s recent fight against Spotify initially targeted Rogan’s podcast, but now he seems to be blaming Spotify’s leadership instead. In an <a href=\"https://neilyoungarchives.com/news/1/article?id=A-Message-From-Neil-I-Say\">open letter posted to his website</a> on Monday, Young says that CEO Daniel Ek is all about “numbers - not art, not creativity.” </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"tSJehF\"><q>Neil urges people to “ditch the misinformers” in his letter.</q></aside></div><p id=\"OydtMQ\">Young ended Monday’s letter by urging Spotify employees to “be free and take the good path.” (I’d argue it’s difficult to feel free when you’ve no longer got a job, but perhaps he’s expecting they’ll find a different one first.) This is at least the third time Young has slammed Spotify in recent weeks: after pulling his music, he <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22906722/neil-young-spotify-sound-quality-amazon-apple-music\">went on to rail against its sound quality</a>, calling it “shitty degraded and neutered.” </p><p id=\"s2mVe9\">Joni Mitchell also pulled her music from Spotify, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/29/22907696/joni-mitchell-spotify-joe-rogan-podcast-misinformation-covid-19\">citing Rogan and COVID misinformation</a>, as did India Arie who said it was also because of “his language around race.” A video of Rogan said the n-word on his podcast went viral, which later led to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/5/22919271/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-slur-planet-of-the-apes\">Rogan apologizing</a>. He also pulled <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/6/22921203/spotify-joe-rogan-episode-removal-internal-memo\">70 episodes of his podcast from the service</a>.</p><p id=\"xH3k5s\">Ek, and Spotify as a company, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/7/22921608/spotify-joe-rogan-moderation-guidelines-episode-deletion\">seem to be giving mixed messages about how it wants to run its platform as the situation unfolds</a>. The one thing that’s clear is that the company’s podcasting ambitions are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904463/joe-rogan-spotify-neil-young-decision-moderation-podcasts\">heavily dependent on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em></a><em> </em>(which made backing Rogan, instead of Neil Young, a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22903354/spotify-joe-rogan-removing-neil-young-music\">relatively easy decision</a>). But the company is also, obviously, highly dependent on its employees. While it’s hard to say how much sway Young has with them, the Rogan situation has evidently <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22915456/spotify-ceo-joe-rogan-daniel-ek-town-hall-speech-platform-podcast\">caused a good deal of tension within Spotify</a>, and that’s something Ek will likely have to navigate as it continues to evolve.</p><aside id=\"k1GHXp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Spotify is more confused about Joe Rogan than ever\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/7/22921608/spotify-joe-rogan-moderation-guidelines-episode-deletion\"}]}'></div></aside>",
