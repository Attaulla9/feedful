(<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition\">Apple’s Arm laptop chips wowed the industry in late 2020</a>, putting other manufacturers on notice.)</p><p id=\"wATN6f\">Nvidia declined to comment to <em>The Verge</em>, not even to confirm or deny that the deal had fallen through. Softbank and Arm didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. None of the companies have publicly confirmed that the deal is off; it’s possible they are waiting until financial markets open in the UK or Japan, where Arm and Softbank are headquartered respectively. Softbank is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SoftBank_Group/status/1490842193132593152\">scheduled to report earnings</a> later today on Japan time.</p><p id=\"wOfWHl\">It wouldn’t be much of a surprise if the deal had fallen through, since it’s been a rough road for Nvidia pretty much since the start, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang frequently having to defend it in public and eventually admitting <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632017/nvidia-acquisition-arm-timeframe-18-months-schedule-regulatory-scrutiny\">it might take much longer than planned</a>. Scarcely two weeks ago, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/25/22900456/nvidia-arm-acquisition-deal-trouble-regulator-worries-report\">the deal was falling through</a>, after challenges from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785832/nvidias-arm-acquisition-scrutiny-uk-government\">UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22266504/nvidia-arm-deal-eu-formal-investigation-merger\">EU</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826293/nvidia-arm-acquisition-ftc-case-antitrust-chips-semiconductor-lawsuit\">US</a> regulators worried about what Nvidia might do if it owned Arm. The FTC also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814633/nvidia-arm-purchase-semiconductor-ftc-40-billion-lawsuit-block-deal\">sued to stop the acquisition</a>.</p>",
