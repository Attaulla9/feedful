It’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967472/apple-black-magic-trackpad-peripherals-mouse-charging\">a slick-looking black version</a>. It also still has its charging port on the bottom — meaning that six and a half years after its introduction, Apple still seems to think that the best way to charge the mouse is by flipping it over (rendering it useless) and plugging in a Lightning cable.</p><p id=\"AdGhmn\">Here’s a little secret: I copied and pasted most of that last sentence from an article I wrote about this exact issue <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394552/apple-new-magic-mouse-charging-port-bottom-lightning\">nearly a year ago</a>, when Apple introduced a whole line of colorful Magic Mice and had the opportunity to change how they charge, but didn’t. Apple has kept this charge-on-the-bottom design since October 2015. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"8IwxMx\"><q>“Like a beetle with its legs in the air”</q></aside></div><p id=\"ExrbpI\">My former <em>Verge</em> colleague Nick Statt ridiculed the mouse’s design <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse\">the December after it was introduced</a>, pointing out that Apple asks the mouse users to “flip the device on its back like a beetle with its legs in the air and plug in the cable.” I included part of that quote in my article last year, too, and am mentioning it once again here because I still think it’s a good metaphor for how silly it all looks.</p><p id=\"aAFwzm\">Most rechargeable wireless mice let you plug them in, so you can use them while charging. But for some reason, Apple steadfastly refuses to put a charging port anywhere but under the Magic Mouse. The company has shown a willingness to fix many of its other odd design decisions — the newer Apple Pencil doesn’t need to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023772/new-apple-pencil-2-2018-ipad-stylus-price-release-date\">stick out of a Lightning port</a> to charge, for example, and the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price\">Apple TV Siri Remote</a> dumped the old touchpad for a scroll wheel and a clickpad. </p><p id=\"Bgftws\">With <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22962081/apple-mac-studio-m1-max-ultra-price-specs-processor-release-date\">the new Mac Studio</a>, Apple even put a couple USB-C ports and an SDXC card slot <em>on the front</em> instead of shoving all of them in the back, reflecting Apple’s recent willingness to give people ports they want in obvious places (see also: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future\">the many ports on the new MacBook Pros</a>). But the underside charging port for the Magic Mouse lives on.</p><p id=\"u3X7Na\">To be fair, Apple claims on its website that the Magic Mouse’s battery will “power your Magic Mouse for about a month or more between charges,” so you won’t have to plug the mouse in every week. But in my past experiences with wireless mice, I would use them until their batteries were completely drained, and then would scramble to find a charging cable so I could use them wired for a short while as they charged. With the Magic Mouse, I wouldn’t be able to do that; I’d have to shove it off to the side while it rested on its back to get some more juice and hope that I have another mouse or trackpad lying around that I could use in the interim.</p><p id=\"FhH3j1\">If you still want the black Magic Mouse in spite of its frustrating charging situation, you can order one from <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2E3AM/A/magic-mouse-white-multi-touch-surface\">Apple’s website right now</a> — but you should know that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967472/apple-black-magic-trackpad-peripherals-mouse-charging\">like the new black trackpad</a>, it’s $20 more expensive than the white one.</p>",
