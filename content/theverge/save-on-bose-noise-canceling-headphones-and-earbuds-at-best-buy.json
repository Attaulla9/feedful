Currently, you can find the Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098FKXT8L/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> or <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgoISm7Tx1n\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $279, matching their lowest price. <em>The Verge</em> staffer Chris Welch <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed</a> the QuietComfort 45 headphones for us and was generally impressed by the overall comfort and effective noise cancellation of these headphones.</p><p id=\"BHpjnx\">The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are also on sale, discounted from their regular $279 price to $219.99 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Noise-Cancelling-Earbuds/dp/B08C4KWM9T?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cf2gGscIjTO\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>. These earbuds have been available for as low as $199.99 before, but they haven’t been available for that price since early January. Chris Welch also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed</a> these earbuds for us and praised their sound quality and noise-cancellation capabilities.</p><div id=\"E9bVos\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10893423\"></div></div><div id=\"M5bmHx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10875879\"></div></div><p id=\"6dyXZb\">In our list of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22950789/best-soundbar\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best soundbars to buy in 2022</a>, we called the Roku Streambar the best soundbar with built-in streaming apps. This simple 2.0 soundbar that also operates as a 4K HDR streaming device typically sells for $129.99 but is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streambar-Streaming-Premium-Released/dp/B08G8JH836?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently discounted at Amazon for $99</a>. It’s not the lowest price we’ve seen for this soundbar, but it’s a good value for a device that provides improved sound and a versatile streaming platform. While the Streambar supports HDMI ARC, it can also be used with standard HDMI in combination with an optical audio input.</p><div id=\"c4f8hA\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11067232\"></div></div><p id=\"A0MGrt\">If you don’t mind refurbished products, Best Buy is offering some excellent discounts on the Sonos Roam Bluetooth speaker. Brand-new, this speaker can cost $169.99, but you can currently <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgKsEUlDIf2\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pick up a Geek Squad refurbished model for just $149.99</a>. Overall, we were impressed by the rugged, weatherproof design of the Sonos Roam in addition to its playback options, which include AirPlay 2, Alexa, and Google Assistant. Just like other Best Buy refurbished tech, this device is tested and guaranteed to work out of the box and, if for any reason you aren’t satisfied, can be returned within 15 days of receipt of the product. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><div id=\"fac8KY\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11077060\"></div></div><p id=\"tdUzTX\">Secretlab is having a small sale throughout the month of March on its Omega, Titan, and Titan XL gaming chairs, as well as desk mats for the new Magnus gaming desk.</p><p id=\"ANAcTY\">The 2022 models of Secretlab’s gaming chairs are only getting a $30 discount, with the <a href=\"https://secretlab.co/products/titan-evo-2022-series?sku=R22PU-Stealth\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Titan Evo discounted to $519</a>, a small reduction from its usual $549 price. However, the 2020 series chairs are currently getting slightly more sizeable discounts, with its <a href=\"https://secretlab.co/collections/omega-series#omega_2020-stealth\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Omega Stealth gaming chair discounted to $409</a> from its typical $449 price tag. While both of these chairs use PU leather, you can also find similar discounts on chairs that use Secretlab’s breathable SoftWeave fabric. Just expect to pay a little more. However, if you’re in the market for a genuine NAPA leather model, Secretlab has discounted those as well, dropping the price of its 2020 Omega model to $719 from its usual $849 price.</p><div id=\"Xz68qo\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10334250\"></div></div><div id=\"meUhQW\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11076919\"></div></div><p id=\"I5l2Pm\">The 2020 and 2022 models of Secretlab’s gaming chairs are incredibly similar, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22568759/secretlab-titan-evo-gaming-chair-features-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">but the newer model does include a few noticeable improvements</a>. This includes integrated lumbar support instead of a lumbar pillow, arms with magnetized covers that can be replaced more easily, and a magnetic headrest that replaces the elastic fastener used in the older models.     </p><p id=\"hxWJKe\">You can also save up to $50 when bundling a desk mat with a Magnus gaming desk, <a href=\"https://secretlab.co/products/magnus-metal-desk\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bringing the overall price of select models down to $578</a> from its typical $628.
