Alongside the top-of-the-line CPU could be a Qualcomm Adreno 730 graphics chip, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. The device is also rumored to have a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 3216 x 1440px and a refresh rate of 120Hz. <em>WinFuture </em>also found that the phone may come with a 5,000mAH battery pack, in addition to having 80W fast-charging capabilities.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kw--UEedy6OP73qjJ-4cq8sGzWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23222038/oppo_phone_white_back.png\">      <cite>Image by <em>WinFuture</em></cite>      <figcaption>The Find X5 Pro may come in black and white.</figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"NCR4Nv\">While the device may house a 32MP front-facing camera, there are three camera sensors on the back: a 50MP main camera, a 50MP wide-angle camera, and a 13MP telephoto camera. There’s also some text written on the phone’s rear camera that says “Powered by MariSilicon X,” referring to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833796/oppo-air-glass-ar-glasses-announced-china-release-date\">Oppo’s in-house NPU used for image processing</a>. This only corroborates last month’s leak, which shows the MariSilicon X mentioned in the device’s settings.</p><p id=\"hkAeaB\">Pricing information still hasn’t been confirmed, but <em>WinFuture</em> predicts a price tag of over 1,200€ (~$1,375). Like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22411538/oppo-find-x3-pro-review\">its predecessor, the Find X3 Pro</a>, the Find X5 Pro is expected to become available in Europe.</p><p id=\"JNoIIG\">So far, the Find X5 Pro is sounding a lot like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs\">the OnePlus 10 Pro</a>, which makes sense with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo\">OnePlus becoming an Oppo sub-brand</a>. The OnePlus 10 Pro was released in China in January (with the US and European release date TBD), and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs\">also comes with</a> the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, 6.7-inch display, and support for 80W charging. Like the OnePlus 10 Pro, the Find X5 Pro is also supposed to have a camera system created in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22865569/oneplus-10-pro-camera-specs\">partnership with Swedish camera manufacturer Hasselblad</a>.</p><p id=\"E1ikEc\"><em><strong>Correction</strong></em><em>: This article originally stated that Oppo would become a sub-brand of OnePlus, which is incorrect. OnePlus is an Oppo sub-brand. We regret the error.</em></p>",
