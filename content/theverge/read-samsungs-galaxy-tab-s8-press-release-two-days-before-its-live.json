Ahead of the big show, leaked renders, pictures, and even a press release have revealed just about everything regarding the unannounced Galaxy Tab S8 lineup, which is the first to include a high-end “Ultra” model. Not only that, that Tab S8 Ultra has already been photographed in the wild.</p><p id=\"mKYrvF\">Let’s start first with that press release. Serial leaker Evan Blass shared images of what looks to be Samsung’s <a href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F412d9113-5f18-4de7-965b-e2fd7e614037_1840x3600.jpeg\">entire press release about the Tab S8 lineup</a> from his <a href=\"https://evleaks.substack.com/p/coming-soon?showWelcome=true\">Leakland Substack</a>, and the release <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22902649/samsung-galaxy-s22-unpacked-event-tab-s8-home-mini-2-date\">corroborates other rumors</a> about Samsung’s expected three new tablet models: the Galaxy Tab S8, S8 Plus, and S8 Ultra. Just a few highlights from the release: the tablets will apparently support Wi-Fi 6E and 45-watt fast charging, and the S8 Plus and S8 Ultra will come with a “new and improved” S Pen stylus that “uses a prediction algorithm for ultra-low latency.”</p><p id=\"oeQJG3\">Blass also shared a truckload of detailed renders. According to the renders, the Tab S8 will be the smallest of the bunch with an 11-inch screen and a 2560 x 1600 resolution; the Tab S8 Plus will be the next step up with a 12.4-inch screen and a 2800 x 1752 resolution; and the Tab S8 Ultra will have a huge 14.6-inch screen with a 2960 x 1848 resolution (and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890937/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-tablet-android-leak\">a notch)</a>. The Plus and Ultra will also have OLED screens, while the standard Tab S8 will have an LCD screen.</p><div id=\"YpYf4l\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11017447\"></div></div><p id=\"dtz8u6\">The renders shared by Blass additionally reveal some accessories that will launch alongside the Ultra, including a keyboard cover reminiscent of Apple and Microsoft’s covers for the iPad Pro and Surface lines. It also appears Samsung will offer a cover with no keyboard, if that’s your preferred option.</p><div id=\"2dvFGO\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11017441\"></div></div><p id=\"x9RjdV\">If the leaks already have you interested in one of the tablets, it seems you’ll be able to get your own soon — according to the press release, you’ll be able to pre-order the Tab 8 lineup starting February 9th at 10AM ET, and the devices will launch on February 25th beginning with “select markets” that include the US, Europe, and Korea.</p><p id=\"79QKqn\">And if you want an idea of what the Tab S8 Ultra’s notched screen looks like in real life before getting one for yourself, check out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryeonHan/status/1490288934303444995\">this photo shared on Twitter</a>:</p><div id=\"uA5Cxv\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"ko\" dir=\"ltr\">오우 거대한게 멋지네 <a href=\"https://t.co/r6aS8NMaDX\">pic.twitter.com/r6aS8NMaDX</a></p>— 한가련 (@GaryeonHan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryeonHan/status/1490288934303444995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 6, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"YcNkGb\">At Unpacked, Samsung is also expected to reveal the Galaxy S22 series of smartphones, including a Note-inspired S22 Ultra.
