Of course, another way to tell long-time users that there’s a future for Tumblr would be to develop more new features that don’t cost money, and its <a href=\"https://staff.tumblr.com/post/677001795032186880/hey-there-weve-got-news-were-introducing-a-new#notes\">new blog viewer on the dashboard</a> is a decent start. For the next move, here’s a free idea: Tumblr NSFW, $14.99, ad-free and unblurred for less than the cost of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884263/netflix-price-increases-2021-us-canada-all-plans-hd-4k\">HD Netflix</a>.</p><aside id=\"qrKHWM\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"After the porn ban, Tumblr users have ditched the platform as promised \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266013/tumblr-porn-ban-lost-users-down-traffic\"},{\"title\":\"How Tumblr went from being the most porn-friendly social media site to banning porn \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18126451/tumblr-porn-social-media-ban\"}]}'></div></aside>",
