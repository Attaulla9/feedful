If you’ve been on the hunt for a pair of good (and very unique) earbuds, Ultimate Ears’ Presidents’ Day sale involved a solid deal on the UE Fits that’s definitely worth a look. </p><p id=\"QgS1HM\">Normally $249, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://custom.ultimateears.com/products/ue-fits&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22939133/presidents-day-best-sales-2022-tech-deals-headphones-laptops-tvs-gaming&amp;xcust=___vg__p_22703174__t_w__r_google.com__d_D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">right now, you can buy the Fits for $199</a>. That’s a sizeable discount on a pair of true wireless buds that are capable of permanently molding to the shape of your ear in 60 seconds, thus ensuring the best fit possible. (<strong>Note</strong>: a pop-up should display when you click the link that will offer you another $30 off on top of this discount if you sign up for marketing emails and agree to receive text messages from Ultimate Ears — not bad!)</p><p id=\"H5KvpE\">What’s more, the Fits also come with lengthy, 8-hour battery life, allowing you to comfortably listen to tunes for hours on end. While they don’t offer noise cancellation like some of their similarly priced rivals, they’re still a solid choice with good sound quality, especially if you find that Apple’s AirPods or Samsung’s Galaxy Buds never fit quite right. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"nLm9oJ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10881349\"></div></div><p id=\"H3zk14\">For those on the market for an affordable 4K TV, Amazon and Best Buy are selling Amazon’s new Omni Fire TV at an all-time low. All configurations are discounted today, including the larger versions, which support Dolby Vision HDR. The 65-inch, for example, is selling for $499.99 instead of $829.99 at both <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgGxqukMOGD\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, which is the first time we’ve seen such a steep discount on the bigger model. If you’re looking for a TV under $500, the 55-inch model (that doesn’t support Dolby Vision) is also on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgD5vRa85Gw\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $369.99, a $190 off the list price.</p><p id=\"Lz3O5L\">As noted <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in our review</a>, Amazon’s first self-branded TV shows great promise, and we praised it for its low input lag, support for two-way video calling, and its ability to query Alexa even when the TV is off. It might offer so-so picture quality — including lackluster black levels and a typical 60Hz refresh rate — but it’s hard to beat in terms of pricing. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"i7EjUP\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10974346\"></div></div><div id=\"jXSc1O\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10848642\"></div></div><p id=\"5ELbOn\">Deals on the upmarket, stainless steel Apple Watch Series 7 models tend to be harder to come by than the cheaper aluminum versions, which is why today’s discount on the more expensive models is such a standout deal. If you don’t mind splurging for a more premium, LTE-ready variant of Apple’s newest smartwatch, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HFDRG87?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon is currently selling the 45mm, stainless steel version</a> in silver with a silver loop for $749.99, a $49 discount and an all-time low. </p><p id=\"XGfilr\">Other configurations and sizes are also discounted in select colors. Right now, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HDVZ7X9?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">41mm, gold stainless steel model is on sale with LTE and a purple Sport Band for $649.99</a> ($50 off) at Amazon, its best price to date. You can also pick up its <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HFGSQH5?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">41mm, LTE-equipped model with a gray stainless steel case</a> and a blue Sport Band for $619 ($80 off).</p><p id=\"00hNQp\">While similar in design to the cheaper aluminum models, the stainless steel version boasts slightly more refined colors and increased durability. However, it’s otherwise functionally identical, with a larger, edge-to-edge display and faster charging than the Series 6, dust resistance, and the ability to set multiple timers. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"WBU6Ml\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11061881\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 in tent mode, angled slightly to the left.

It boasts one of the best Chromebook screens she’s ever used, along with a powerful 11th Gen Intel processor that makes it easy to multitask and open a ton of tabs without an issue. It also offers a variety of other praiseworthy features, including two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 4, a good backlit keyboard, and a smooth touchpad. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"qIgRYy\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11062147\"></div></div><p id=\"W3BEWn\">It may have launched in 2017, but <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> remains <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22174197/nintendo-switch-best-games-2020-animal-crossing-pokemon\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one of the best games</a> you can play on the Nintendo Switch. It’s a title that doesn’t often receive sizeable discounts, however, which is why today’s Walmart deal is worth a look. For those who have yet to play the classic role-playing game, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLegend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Switch-Nintendo-Digital-Download%2F800322001&amp;subid1=TheVergeDailyDealsFeb232022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart is now selling the digital version for $37.76</a> instead of $59.99.

While more recent models have knocked it down from being our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">favorite wired gaming mouse</a>, it’s still an excellent, supportive option that features a basic assortment of buttons and is comfortable enough to use for hours on end. It’s not filled with as many features as our new top pick, the Razer Basilisk V3, but we believe it does a great job of nailing the basics. </p><div id=\"uNdna7\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10674248\"></div></div><h2 id=\"3vkH7g\">Here are some other great deals happening today</h2><ul><li id=\"4XsMuk\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X6MH37F?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">You can buy the matte-black Level Lock for $211.60</a> from Amazon. That’s a $38 discount and the second-best price yet on the smart lock, which is easy to install, boasts long battery life, and is compatible with most standard US deadbolts. Note, however, it only works with Apple’s HomeKit, as well as Amazon’s Ring platform via Amazon Sidewalk. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21304792/level-lock-smart-homekit-review-test-price-specs-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></li><li id=\"YR45Q6\">The new version of Lenovo’s Smart Clock Essential, which offers support for Amazon Alexa, is on sale for the first time since launching last month.
