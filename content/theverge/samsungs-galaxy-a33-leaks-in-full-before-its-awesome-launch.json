These include a 6.4-inch 90Hz 1080p OLED display, a 5,000mAh battery, and four rear cameras. It’ll reportedly be priced at €379 in Europe, which is roughly $417 stateside.</p><p id=\"j0iRDv\">Reports suggest the Galaxy A33 will be announced alongside the Galaxy A53 and Galaxy A73 at Samsung’s “Awesome Galaxy A Event” this week. Samsung’s midrange A-series are some of its most popular devices around the world. In fact, the Samsung Galaxy A12 was the sixth best-selling phone in the world in 2021 <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-top-10-smartphones-2021/\">according to Counterpoint Research</a>, and was the only one of Samsung’s phones to appear in the top ten (the rest were overwhelmingly iPhones, with two Xiaomis). </p><div id=\"n1FCDz\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">A33 <a href=\"https://t.co/U7xb7dE6uk\">pic.twitter.com/U7xb7dE6uk</a></p>— Ev (@evleaks) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1503595528168353793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"h1YF2r\">According to <em>Appuals</em>, the Galaxy A33 will be powered by Samsung’s Exynos 1280, an unannounced processor that’s rumored to have an octa-core CPU. Its cameras are thought to consist of a main 48-megapixel camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view, a 5-megapixel macro, a 2-megapixel portrait lens, and a 13-megapixel selfie camera. It’ll reportedly have an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, an under-display fingerprint sensor, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and won’t come with a charging brick in the box.</p><div id=\"mjGpg2\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Samsung Galaxy A53 5G full specifications! <a href=\"https://t.co/HJHaWLDgZl\">pic.twitter.com/HJHaWLDgZl</a></p>— Sudhanshu Ambhore (@Sudhanshu1414) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sudhanshu1414/status/1500090156405358597?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 5, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"QUngvM\">Stepping up to the Galaxy A53, whose alleged specs were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sudhanshu1414/status/1500090156405358597\">posted to Twitter earlier in the month</a>, could get buyers a bigger 6.5-inch display with a higher 120Hz refresh rate. It’s still got the same Exynos 1280 processor as well as a quad-camera array, but the resolution of its main camera will apparently be higher at 64-megapixels, and its depth sensor will reportedly be 5-megapixels in resolution. We’re looking at a 32-megapixel selfie camera on this model, with the rest of its specs being roughly in line with the Galaxy A33. </p><p id=\"x4JUkG\">Finally there’s the Galaxy A73. There’s less information about this model, but we’ve got some hints thanks to alleged press shots <a href=\"https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/official-samsung-galaxy-a73-press-shot/\">unearthed by <em>91Mobiles</em></a>, which appear to show that the A73 will have much smaller bezels than the A53. </p><p id=\"r7qPvn\">The Galaxy A33, A53, and A73 will join the <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-a03-launched-in-india/\">Galaxy A03</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22907086/samsung-galaxy-a13-5g-review-price-screen-specs\">A13</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-a13-and-galaxy-a23-launched-with-quad-rear-cameras-large-batteries-and-more/\">A23</a> in Samsung’s midrange lineup for this year.</p>",
