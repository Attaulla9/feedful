Thanks to <em>9to5Google</em>, which did some digging in the recently-released Android 13 developer preview, we might have an <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/02/14/exclusive-pixel-stream-android-apps-chromebook-pc-video/\">early look at what that feature will look like</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n6D6KlJHE5n_QXzFOIIHT0wnPiU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23242137/Screen_Shot_2022_02_14_at_4.23.17_PM.png\">      <cite>Image: Google</cite>      <figcaption><em>Google first outlined the mirroring feature </em><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/ces2022-bettertogether/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>in January</em></a><em>. </em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"AkK6i0\">Based on what <em>9to5Google</em> found, it appears that Google will essentially enable streaming apps to your computer. And the feature might end up working on non-Chrome OS computers, too, as <em>9to5Google</em> says it used the web app involved on both Chrome OS and on Windows 11. </p><p id=\"RcNIKa\">Here’s how the feature works, according to <em>9to5Google</em>:</p><blockquote><p id=\"KLzKSr\">Your Pixel generates an entirely separate virtual display, which is streamed to your laptop or desktop, rather than simply mirroring your phone’s portrait screen. This second display is where your messaging apps will appear. This means you can have an app open on your laptop/desktop without disrupting any apps running on your phone’s main screen.</p></blockquote><p id=\"9Cf0et\">And it isn’t just messaging — you’ll apparently be able to open <em>any</em> of your phone’s apps:</p><blockquote><p id=\"cSnZMk\">At the bottom left, there’s a menu button that, when clicked, reveals the full list of apps installed on your phone. With this menu, you can launch <em>any</em> app on your phone, not just the messaging apps. In effect, your entire phone is accessible through Pixel’s cross-device streaming.</p></blockquote><p id=\"Nj2JlU\"><a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/02/14/exclusive-pixel-stream-android-apps-chromebook-pc-video/\"><em>9to5Google’s</em> article</a> has some videos and screenshots that do a great job showing off what this app might be capable of, and I highly recommend you check out the story to see it in action. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uYFYovzJlCLIbQDpPJJii7eiVEI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23242106/Screen_Shot_2022_02_14_at_4.16.02_PM.png\">      <cite>Image: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/02/14/exclusive-pixel-stream-android-apps-chromebook-pc-video/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>9to5Google</em></a></cite>      <figcaption><em>Here’s a screenshot from a </em>9to5Google<em> video showing the app streaming Twitter.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"9dzQoc\"><em>9to5Google</em> also got cross-device streaming enabled on Chrome OS, though it seems the publication was only able to get a messaging app working. </p><p id=\"LGqqMc\">As with any feature in development, there’s always the chance that what <em>9to5Google</em> found changes ahead of a public release. And given that we’ve only just gotten the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/10/22926874/android-13-features-developer-previewlanguage-controls\">very first Android 13 developer preview</a>, there’s definitely a possibility that things will look or function much differently if or when these features become available. Still, what <em>9to5Google</em> found seems quite promising.</p><p id=\"hNVvuc\">Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p id=\"2TtqrE\"></p>",
