Our business and commercial activities continue uninterrupted. We are still working to evaluate the nature and scope of the event and don’t have any additional information to share at this time,” reads a statement via Nvidia spokesman Hector Marinez.</p><p id=\"Uq0gqS\">Even <em>The Telegraph</em>’s sources aren’t suggesting that Nvidia has necessarily had any data stolen or deleted, and there’s no current suggestion that the “incident” might be linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22950633/cyberattacks-russia-ukraine-us-cyberwar\">cyberattacks have been part of the offensive</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949115/internet-disruptions-ukraine-kharkiv-russia\">internet infrastructure has also been a target there</a>.</p><p id=\"AhjmIT\"><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-25/nvidia-is-investigating-cyber-attack-but-business-uninterrupted?sref=ExbtjcSG\"><em>Bloomberg</em> is now reporting</a> it was a minor ransomware attack, citing a “person familiar with the incident.” </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"IyEAgO\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">[ALERT] LAPSUS ransomware gang leaked the credentials of NVIDIA employees. And announced that it would soon release 1TB of stolen data. <a href=\"https://t.co/0WVb7G88So\">pic.twitter.com/0WVb7G88So</a></p>— DarkTracer : DarkWeb Criminal Intelligence (@darktracer_int) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darktracer_int/status/1497464801877839872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></div><p id=\"bifPEn\">Early Saturday morning, the dark web intelligence firm DarkTracer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darktracer_int/status/1497464801877839872\">tweeted</a> that Lapsus$, a ransomware gang <a href=\"https://therecord.media/lapsus-ransomware-gang-hits-sic-portugals-largest-tv-channel/\">recently linked to an attack on Portugal’s largest TV channel</a>, has claimed responsibility, leaking what it says are the password hashes for Nvidia employees, and indicating it has other data including source code and information related to RTX GPUs. Soufiane Tahiri <a href=\"https://twitter.com/S0ufi4n3/status/1497672641947308039\">posted a later message from the group to Twitter</a>, where they claimed the company tried to delete their data in a virtual machine via the VPN and device management platform it uses. They apparently claim to still have a backup of the data that they are threatening to leak. There’s still no indication publicly that this is incident is tied to Russia’s invasion.</p><p id=\"GpljcK\">If a US-based company like Nvidia had been targeted, though, it could provoke retaliation from the United States. “If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we’re prepared to respond,” President Biden said during his Thursday address.</p><p id=\"okwr9e\">While the alleged attack reportedly knocked out Nvidia’s email, we did receive Nvidia’s statement today from an Nvidia email address. </p><p id=\"lzQglD\">Nvidia also mysteriously asked press late Wednesday evening to push back a minor announcement that would have arrived on Thursday, without providing an explanation. That timing lines up with when <em>The Telegraph</em> reports that Nvidia’s systems were compromised.</p><p id=\"8oP1WM\"><em><strong>Update, 5:47PM ET: </strong></em><em>Added that Bloomberg is now citing a source that the “incident” was a ransomware attack.</em></p><p id=\"tBBuRe\"><em><strong>Update, February 26th, 6:37ET: </strong></em><em>Added information about Lapsus$ Group claiming to be responsible for the ransomware attack.</em></p><p id=\"Nnxw11\"></p>",
