The new device, he suggests, will arrive with 5G, a faster A15 CPU chip, and better cameras. It will share the same design as the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price\">current iPhone SE</a>, however, which means the new SE may also retain the Touch ID feature.</p><p id=\"eEIiNe\">Meanwhile, Gurman also theorizes Apple will announce the latest iteration of the iPad Air. The new tablet is expected to arrive with a new CPU and 5G for cellular-equipped models. Apple, Gurman postulates, could additionally roll out the new iOS 15.4 update, making it possible to unlock Face ID-equipped iPhones and iPads <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22912677/apple-face-id-mask-update-ios-15-4-beta-hands-on-impressions\">while wearing a face mask</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904957/apple-universal-control-ipados-15-4-macos-monterey-12-3-betas\">A Universal Control feature</a> is additionally expected to make its debut with the new update, which would mean users could use one keyboard and mouse across multiple iPads and Macs. </p><p id=\"3XHwfZ\">It’s also rumored another Mac with Apple-designed chips may arrive in March, but that won’t be something we’ll likely see at this particular event. Neither will we most likely see the new iPhone 14 models, AirPods, Apple Watches, MacBook Air, iMac, and Mac Pro desktops rumored to launch later in 2022.</p><aside id=\"SfhRPF\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple will reportedly debut an M2 chip with four new Macs this year\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/20/22943411/apple-m2-chip-new-macs-rumor\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"PcXoG5\"></p><p id=\"fpCUYS\"></p><p id=\"gISNAP\"></p>",
