It’s typically the world’s largest mobile technology show, where some of the biggest smartphone brands announce their latest devices and new technologies.</p><p id=\"SKd0Yi\">In recent years, the show’s big focus has been on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151055/honor-9x-pro-release-date-price-camera-google-apps-service-mwc\">transition to 5G</a> as well as the emergence of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g\">foldable smartphones</a>. But there’s always space for a handful of non-smartphone announcements, whether it’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238323/lenovo-thinkpad-ideapad-updates-mwc-2019\">new laptops</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch\">smartwatch updates</a>.</p><p id=\"IXHPHx\">In 2020, the show was canceled, and in 2021, it was a quiet affair. 2022 could be a little different, with major announcements expected from several phonemakers. Samsung, which launched its new Galaxy S22 line earlier this month, also has an event planned. So let’s look at what we can expect from Europe’s biggest mobile show.</p><h2 id=\"QKsAcW\">A Samsung mobile device that isn’t a phone</h2><p id=\"f3Z7jd\">Samsung is set to kick off <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/17/22938681/samsung-february-27-mwc-event-galaxy-book-laptop\">its livestream event</a> ahead of MWC on February 27th. The company has traditionally used MWC as a launch point for its flagship mobile devices, but in the last few years, it’s launched those phones weeks in advance. This year’s Galaxy S22 is already available in stores. This means we’ll likely see a new Galaxy Book laptop instead. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/18/22940675/vergecast-podcast-486-project-endgame-spotify-podsights-chartable\">In our preview of MWC on <em>The Vergecast</em></a> last week, Monica Chin said the company is one of the most interesting companies in laptop design right now. </p><h2 id=\"gehg73\">Even more laptops</h2><p id=\"dCDhTB\">The “mobile” in Mobile World Congress doesn’t just stand for smartphones, as laptops also have a presence at the show. While many manufacturers tend to show off their laptops at CES, we’re expecting to see even more at MWC.</p><p id=\"P51Oam\">Acer has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22947886/acer-swift-5-announced-price-specs-release-date\">already revealed</a> its new Swift 5 laptop with a 16:10 display, and we’ll likely see other new notebooks from companies like Lenovo. We might even see a new MateBook from Huawei. </p><h2 id=\"oN0CtL\">Big phones from some of the biggest companies in China</h2><p id=\"3oxcYn\">This year, we can still expect new smartphone entries from big Chinese manufacturers, including TCL and Oppo, which just <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22948778/oppo-find-x5-pro-announced-specs-features-camera\">unveiled its flagship</a> Find X5 Pro. Huawei is also extremely likely to show off a new batch of phones with its OS, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430275/huawei-harmonyos-smartphones-release-date\">HarmonyOS</a>. In previous years, it’s used MWC as a launch platform for its folding phones, so it wouldn’t be outside the realm of possibility to see a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price\">Mate X2</a> successor this year.</p><h2 id=\"7EJbm7\">A Pixel 6A?</h2><p id=\"ckHRDk\">Designs for what looks like a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22948008/pixel-7-renders-leak-rumors-google-pixel-6\">Google Pixel 6 successor</a> leaked this week — and while that’s not likely to surface at MWC, a leak last year suggested that a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/20/22793079/google-pixel-6a-leak-compact-mobile-no-headphone-jack\">Pixel 6A might be incoming</a>. Either way, expect the search giant to reveal something.</p><h2 id=\"mz8Tzy\">Oh no, O-RAN and 6G?</h2><p id=\"FqJ88I\">Finally, expect some updates in the cellular communications space. The O-RAN Alliance is <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220214005596/en/O-RAN-ALLIANCE-Announces-New-Demonstrations-of-O-RAN-Technology-and-Details-of-its-Industry-Briefing-at-MWC-Barcelona\">planning a series of demonstrations</a> to show how AI can efficiently run 5G networks. O-RAN or Open Radio Access Network, is the same tech Dish is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949389/dish-network-5g-las-vegas\">working on</a> in the US. Thus far, it’s been a technology that makes big promises but massively under-delivers. But things could be different this time! </p><p id=\"qG2DRX\">And if you’re already tired of 5G, get ready. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fabout-us%2Fnewsroom%2Farticles%2Fnokias-vision-for-the-6g-era%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F2%2F25%2F22949369%2Fmwc-barcelona-2022-what-to-expect-rumors-announcements\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nokia</a> has plans to start talking about “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234540/donald-trump-6g-internet-5g-us-telecom-cell-network-carriers\">6G</a>.”</p><p id=\"3zBTwW\">You can follow all stories relating to MWC at <em>The Verge</em> by checking out our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949007/mwc-barcelona-2022-news-rumors-products-annoucements\">story stream</a>.</p><p id=\"pP7mc8\"></p>",
