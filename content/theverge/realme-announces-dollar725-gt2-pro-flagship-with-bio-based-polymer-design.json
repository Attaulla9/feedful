The former Oppo sub-brand describes it as “the most premium flagship ever by Realme,” and it’s difficult to disagree with that assessment.</p><p id=\"zuYd6b\">The headline feature of the GT2 Pro is how it looks and feels. Continuing the company’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20685836/realme-x-naoto-fukasawa-hands-on-review\">materials collaboration</a> with legendary Japanese designer Naoto Fukasawa, the GT2 Pro is the first phone to be made with a “bio-based polymer,” which Realme claims reduces carbon emissions by 35.5 percent during manufacturing. </p><p id=\"kkQ2Ef\">The “paper green” model I’ve been using has a unique matte finish that feels coarse to the touch and doesn’t pick up fingerprints. I can’t speak to Realme’s environmental claims, but this phone doesn’t feel cheap in the slightest — I think it looks great and feels better than glossy glass or plastic. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQPcD5mpJDd9tlkU44IL6xuSa-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23276855/IMG_2107.jpg\">  </figure><p id=\"ynBvAA\">The camera system has quite a lot in common with last year’s flagship Oppo Find X3 Pro. There’s a 50-megapixel main camera with the same IMX766 sensor, and the ultrawide is also 50 megapixels but presumably uses a smaller sensor because Realme calls it the “world’s first 150-degree” ultrawide. The results are quite distorted, and Realme leans into this by exaggerating the distortion even further for a dedicated fisheye mode that captures circular images. The third lens in the camera array is a 40x “micro-lens” ultra-macro camera similar to the Find X3 Pro’s, though there’s no ring light. There’s no telephoto camera of any kind.</p><p id=\"3Uf2ej\">The GT2 Pro has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor alongside up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The screen is a 1-120Hz 1440p LTPO OLED panel with a much smaller chin than on the previous GT. There’s a 5.000mAh battery that can be fast-charged up to 65W, but unfortunately there’s still no wireless charging, which is something that would hold me back from ranking this alongside other flagship phones.</p><p id=\"n2FDND\">The Realme GT2 Pro starts at €649 (~$725) in Europe. Realme is also releasing a non-Pro version of the GT2 with a Snapdragon 888, a less extreme 119-degree ultrawide, and a more conventional macro lens, with pricing starting at €449 (~$500).</p>",
