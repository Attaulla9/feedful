This is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740195/nintendo-advance-wars-1-2-re-boot-camp-switch-switch-remaster-delay\">the second time</a> the game has been delayed. Nintendo originally moved the game from December 2021 to Spring 2022 reasoning that “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1451533822022066179\">the game just needs a little more time for fine tuning</a>.”</p><p id=\"1Qk1L6\">The military tactics game is a reboot of <em>Advance Wars</em> and <em>Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</em> and features tanks, helicopters, and heavily armed soldiers exploding city buildings and other public infrastructure. Although Nintendo didn’t specifically cite the invasion of Ukraine, its allusion to “recent world events” implies the conflict as the reason for the delay. Nintendo has also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22961869/nintendo-eshop-russia-maintenance-mode\">suspended its eShop in Russia</a> due to the shop’s inability to process payment in Russian rubles.</p><p id=\"ppSljo\">With no new release date pending for <em>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp,</em> Nintendo has asked fans to “please stay tuned for updates.” </p>",
