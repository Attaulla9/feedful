The change is one of many the company is reportedly making to its policies as it prepares to have employees return to its offices.</p><p id=\"12ETUN\">The company originally announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant\">in June</a> that it would be requiring vaccinations to return to the office, and reportedly sent a memo <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work\">in December</a> telling employees they would risk being forced to take leave or even being fired if they did not prove they were vaccinated (or apply for an exemption). But a Google spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that vaccines were no longer required for US employees, so it appears the company has adjusted its policy.</p><p id=\"xpdG9P\">Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p id=\"ABXSN6\">CNBC also shared details from a memo sent to staff by David Radcliffe, Google’s VP of real estate and workplace services. Google is lifting a policy that required anyone entering a Google facility, even vaccinated staffers, to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884539/google-require-negative-molecular-test-covid-19-offices\">have negative COVID-19 molecular test</a>. “Unvaccinated employees who are approved to enter offices will still need to follow additional protocols, including testing and wearing a mask, Radcliffe’s note stated,” according to CNBC.</p><p id=\"unXR6P\">Google is also relaxing policies over some of its famed amenities, CNBC reports:</p><blockquote><p id=\"Z9700m\">Radcliffe also wrote that the company is reopening amenities like fitness centers without appointment and massages; restoring full shuttle service; adding more places to eat free breakfast and lunch; and opening “all informal spaces” such as lounges, game rooms, music rooms, and massage chairs.</p></blockquote><p id=\"XauqKp\">The company said in December that would wait until 2022 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814879/google-return-to-office-covid-omicron-hybrid-work-plans-2022\">to determine its return-to-office plans</a>. When employees are expected to return in-person, Google has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work\">already committed</a> to giving them a 30-day heads up. The company has also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic\">already outlined</a> plans for a hybrid work week where it will expect most employees to be in the office three days per week.</p><p id=\"fku9Xu\">Apple has also begun to relax its COVID-19 policies, as it has dropped mask requirements for customers shopping at its Apple retail stores <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/22/22946560/apple-store-mask-mandate-customers-employees\">in several states</a>. Apple may drop the mandate for retail employees to wear masks as well “in as early as two weeks,” according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1496524646010830849\">a tweet from <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Mark Gurman</a>. </p>",
