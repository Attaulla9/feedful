One is a sequel to 2019’s <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, and the other is a “new <em>Warzone</em> experience,” both of which will be “designed together from the ground-up,” <a href=\"https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2022/02/call-of-duty-warzone-special-briefing-community-update\">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p id=\"PqA4ne\">It’s unclear if the new <em>Warzone</em> experience is a full-on sequel or a major update in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22817392/fortnite-chapter-3-season-1-spider-man-new-island\"><em>Fortnite’s</em> massive chapter changes</a>, and the company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment asking for clarification. However, Activision <em>is</em> promising some big things. You can expect “a massive evolution of battle royale with all-new playspace and a new sandbox mode​,” the blog says, and a new engine that powers “both the new <em>Call of Duty</em> game release and <em>Warzone</em>.” Development of the new <em>Call of Duty</em> game and this new <em>Warzone</em> experience will be led by Infinity Ward, the studio that made <em>Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Infinite Warfare</em>, <em>Ghosts</em>, and other <em>Call of Duty</em> titles (including the original).</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"gAnZnR\"><q>There are also changes on the way intended to fix Warzone</q></aside></div><p id=\"OY3AGN\">Activision also announced changes on how it will improve the current <em>Warzone</em> experience, which has been heavily criticized in recent weeks due to bugs, exploits, and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261947/call-of-duty-warzone-cheaters-hackers-aimbots-wallhacks-problem\">prevalence of cheaters</a>. Activision Blizzard as a whole has come under significant scrutiny following California’s lawsuit against the company that alleged it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay\">fostered a workplace culture of harassment and discrimination</a> and after labor protests and unionization efforts from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/25/22901563/raven-software-union-game-workers-alliance-activision-blizzard\">workers at <em>Call of Duty</em> support studio Raven Software</a>. And Friday’s news arrives hours after <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/02/11/bobby-kotick-activision-blizzard-microsoft-harassment/\">an extensive <em>Washington Post</em> profile</a> of Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick that includes details of lawsuits he’s been involved in. </p><p id=\"QrSOls\">In January, Microsoft announced its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch\">intent to buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion</a>. While <em>Call of Duty</em> would certainly be a valuable Xbox-exclusive property, statements from Microsoft since the acquisition news suggest the company plans to keep <em>Call of Duty</em> and other Activision Blizzard games on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22926884/microsoft-call-of-duty-playstation-multi-platform-activision-blizzard\">multiple platforms</a>.</p>",
