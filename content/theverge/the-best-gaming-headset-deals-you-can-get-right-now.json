Clean and precise audio is essential for competitive gaming, allowing you not just to pinpoint your enemies, but communicate effectively with your teammates. Moreover, recent developments in spatial audio and virtual surround sound have allowed headsets to meet — and occasionally surpass — more expensive audio setups, allowing even the most budget-conscious gamer to obtain a competitive edge at a fraction of the price.</p><p id=\"L38ri8\">While you could always invest in a massive pair of speakers, they’re likely to earn you the dubious distinction of the worst roommate of the decade. Thankfully, the right headset will allow you to keep the running and gunning to yourself, which is why we’ve rounded up a collection of the best deals you can currently find on some of our favorite models.</p><aside id=\"nNSwiH\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy\"},{\"title\":\"The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"jivJMA\">For the sake of clarity, we’ve broken the deals down into two categories: wireless and wired. The former is tailored toward gamers looking for a little less clutter in their setup, while the latter is aimed at anyone who doesn’t mind a little extra cabling, or is looking for a headset that's a little more budget-friendly.</p><h2 id=\"7EBSnw\">The best wireless gaming headset deals</h2><h3 id=\"ac6WRy\">Logitech G435</h3><p id=\"6nDk4v\"><em>Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch</em></p><p id=\"GSF83M\">Definitely the boldest headset on our list, the Logitech G435 is a gaming headset perfect for anyone that isn’t afraid to make a statement. This comfortable, colorful headset is on sale in the blue colorway <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1239245/9383?subId1=VergeBestGamingHeadsetDeals022822&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLogitech-G435-LIGHTSPEED-Bluetooth-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Lightweight-over-ear-headphones-built-in-mics-18h-battery-compatible-Dolby-Atmos-PC-PS4-PS%2F101485946&amp;veh=aff\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> for $59.99 — a modest $20 discount — as well as at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G435-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B08R8GJPC2/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, where it’s available in several other colorways for the same price. </p><p id=\"bqOPQC\">Logitech’s on-ear headset features both Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless connectivity, making it compatible with PCs in addition to consoles and mobile devices. The 18-hour battery life is impressive, too, and while it does lack the more traditional 3.5mm audio jack, the included USB-C cable can be used to simultaneously charge and listen.     </p><p id=\"3Bo973\">While the lightweight headset lacks the prevalent boom-mic design used by other headsets in this category — it opts for beamforming microphones — the integrated mic still manages to provide an adequate audio input solution. This has the added benefit of giving the headset a more traditional, on-ear profile, giving you the option of wearing these in public without broadcasting your gamer status.</p><div id=\"tS3KsZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10866389\"></div></div><h3 id=\"djrvF2\">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</h3><p id=\"EPVc1E\"><em>Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch (via 3.5mm audio)</em></p><p id=\"KDRPr5\">The wireless version of the esports-inspired BlackShark headset from Razer boasts a lightweight, aviator design, and is currently discounted to $139.99 at <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fdesktops-laptops%2Fpc-headsets%2Fproducts%2Frazer-blackshark-v2-pro-wireless-gaming-headset-with-microphone%2F258919.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B08FQG96RP?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. This isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen the comfortable headset go for, but it remains a solid discount on an excellent gaming headset that normally retails for $179.99.</p><p id=\"4TjLw6\">The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro is sturdy and perfectly suited for extended play sessions. The only break in its otherwise innocuous profile is a dedicated knob on the right earcup that allows for quick adjustments to volume when necessary and its detachable boom mic. The headset also features a 3.5mm audio jack and can be paired via 2.4Ghz wireless thanks to the included dongle, but the lack of Bluetooth is a bit disappointing. The V2 Pro is THX 7.1 surround capable, too, and comes with an included license for Razer’s THX spatial audio software.</p><p id=\"NoCFmg\">In terms of battery life, the V2 Pro is capable of lasting up to 24 hours on a single charge, making it one of the longer-lasting headphones on the market. Sadly, however, it still relies on Micro USB for charging.</p><div id=\"QA5j5n\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10919428\"></div></div><h3 id=\"jKN5gn\">Razer Barracuda X</h3><p id=\"U7c1cL\"><em>Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S (via 3.5mm), Nintendo Switch</em></p><p id=\"iMxtmY\">The Razer Barracuda X, another solid entry from team green, is definitely one of Razer’s more versatile (and affordable) options when it comes to wireless gaming headsets. It typically retails for $99.99, but the black colorway is on sale at <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fdesktops-laptops%2Fpc-headsets%2Fproducts%2Frazer-barracuda-x-wireless-gaming-headset%2F295615.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230692/2092?subId1=BestGamingHeadsetDeals012822&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Frazer-barracuda-x-bluetooth-wireless-gaming-headset-for-pc-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-82822972\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Barracuda-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B096N6Q51N/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> right now for $79.99, just $10 shy of its best price to date.</p><p id=\"kwA6xJ\">The Barracuda X is a fairly unremarkable headset at first glance given its standard design, but despite its bulkier profile, is actually lighter than the Razer BlackShark series of headsets. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22566803/razer-barracuda-x-wireless-headset-ps5-nintendo-switch-android\">Our initial impressions</a> by <em>Verge </em>staffer Cameron Faulkner noted how comfortable the Barracuda X was, even after several hours of wear, and mentioned that the design sets a strong precedent for potential future iterations.</p><p id=\"3ovLKR\">While the lack of Bluetooth makes the Barracuda X a poor choice for mobile gaming, the 2.4Ghz wireless dongle uses a USB-C connection, meaning that you won’t have to rely on a 3.5mm audio cable to use the headset with your Nintendo Switch. The USB-C dongle can enable wireless connectivity with PS4 and PS5 thanks to the included adapter, too, but it can’t be used with Microsoft consoles unless you use a wired connection. </p><div id=\"aRl0PA\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10669983\"></div></div><aside id=\"5UbqUK\"><div data-anthem-component=\"actionbox\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"title\":\"Verge Deals on Twitter\",\"description\":\"Join our over 45,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals\",\"label\":\"Follow us!\",\"url\":\"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud\"}'></div></aside><h1 id=\"E9Dfnk\">The best wired gaming headset deals</h1><h3 id=\"Ajs0LR\">Logitech G Pro Gaming Headset</h3><p id=\"gcH5or\"><em>Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch</em></p><p id=\"ENuBME\">Our top entry in the wired category gets serious points for opting for its super-clean aesthetic. The Logitech G Pro headset was designed with esports in mind and is currently <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fdesktops-laptops%2Fpc-headsets%2Fproducts%2Fg-pro-gaming-headset%2F203880.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available at GameStop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G-Pro-Gaming-Headset/dp/B07PHML2XB/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-audio%2Fpro-gaming-headset-passive-noise-cancellation.981-000811.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22876408%2Fbest-gaming-headset-deals-sales\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech</a> for $79.99, a steep discount on its typical $99.99 price tag. This is one of the lower prices we’ve seen for this particular headset, which was already a substantial value prior to the current discount.</p><p id=\"8M9DjP\">The G Pro is remarkably simple in terms of its appearance, with no visible knobs or buttons, and no extra ports with the exception of a second 3.5mm audio jack for the detachable boom mic. In addition to the expected 3.5mm audio cable, the G Pro also comes packaged with velour ear pads that can be swapped with the standard leatherette earcups, as well as an external USB DAC that can be used to fine-tune your audio experience on PC using Logitech’s G Hub software.</p><div id=\"xu1PZQ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10984462\"></div></div><h3 id=\"KNWatD\">HyperX Cloud II</h3><p id=\"eDUC6H\"><em>Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch</em></p><p id=\"bMwPlS\">Reminiscent of the minimalist designs used by Logitech and Corsair, the HyperX Cloud II is a simple and effective headset that’s currently <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Wireless-Detachable-Cancelling/dp/B00SAYCXWG?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale for $69 at Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgv2GyBgH2I\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$70.99 at Best Buy</a> — a decent discount for a headset that usually retails for $99.99.</p><p id=\"mM4SCI\">The Cloud II is a versatile, wired headset that’s remarkably comfortable and features audio fidelity that’s typically reserved for headsets that cost twice as much. The 53mm drivers deliver sound that is both punchy and balanced, much like those found in the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wireless version we reviewed</a> in 2020, and there’s a virtual 7.1 surround sound mode for added effect. The headset also features a detachable, noise-canceling mic, as well as inline remote for adjusting the volume of both the mic and audio playback.</p><p id=\"LJhYff\">It may not be as capable as its wireless sibling, but the HyperX Cloud II remains an excellent option that’s compatible with all contemporary consoles and mobile devices as long as you have a USB-C adapter.</p><div id=\"LRRlfL\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11001321\"></div></div><h3 id=\"WiwNLx\">Razer Kraken</h3><p id=\"dBEWC8\"><em>Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch</em></p><p id=\"Dj6sEk\">An absolute unit of a headset, the Razer Kraken is currently on sale in select colorways at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kraken-Gaming-Headset-2019/dp/B07N86GL5T/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> for $39.99 and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgHqYiQQmyd\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $42.99, roughly $40 off its standard retail price. The massive headset is certainly one of the larger models in Razer’s arsenal, yet it remains a solid choice for anyone who wants powerful sound while gaming on their PC or console.</p><p id=\"GMkKsd\">The Kraken uses an integrated digital-analog converter (DAC), which provides 7.1 virtual surround without the need for additional accessories. However, this feature is only available when connected to PCs running Razer’s THX Spatial Audio software. Additionally, the headset features thick, leatherette ear cups with cooling foam — which are perfect for extended play sessions — as well as a flexible boom mic that retracts into the left earcup when not in use. And, thanks to its 3.5mm audio connection, it's compatible with both consoles and mobile devices, as well as PC.</p><div id=\"gBveii\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11064189\"></div></div><aside id=\"Br6qAt\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside><p id=\"ArMLbF\"></p>",
