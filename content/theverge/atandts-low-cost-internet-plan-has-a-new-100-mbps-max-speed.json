The $30 price-point may seem like a steep increase, but anyone who’s eligible and applies to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/31/22861200/application-now-open-discounted-internet-bills-fcc-affordable-connectivity-program\">the Affordable Connectivity Program</a> can get up to $30 off their internet bill, which would essentially make the highest-tier Access plan free.</p><p id=\"gsAdA9\">Of course, the higher speeds are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc\">dependent on your address</a>, with AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/internet/access/?source=EPcc000000000000U\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noting on its website</a> that 100 Mbps is only available in limited areas. Your household income will also have to be under a certain amount to be eligible for Access from AT&amp;T plans; for a one-person household, the max income is $25,760, and for a three-person household it’s $43,920. People on certain benefit programs like SNAP are also eligible.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"5AnBWu\"><q>The slower plans aren’t going away</q></aside></div><p id=\"iiBHzX\">AT&amp;T is keeping its original Access plans around, which have speeds at 10 Mbps or less for $10 or less. They could be an option for people who can’t or don’t want to apply to the ACP and can’t afford $30 each month. Those plans will still have data caps, though.</p><p id=\"vY0C8L\">It’s good to see internet service providers doing these sorts of upgrades — internet needs have only expanded since COVID started, and speeds like 25 Mbps could be very limiting if more than one person needed to use the internet at a time. Early last year, Comcast <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261402/comcast-internet-essentials-doubling-speed-uploads\">also increased the speeds of its $10 per month plan</a>, going from 25 Mbps to 50. </p><p id=\"lonFK7\"><small><em>Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, </em></small><small>The Verge’s</small><small><em> parent company.</em></small></p>",
