That storage doesn’t come cheap, however. Although the 2TB version of the docking station is listed for <a href=\"https://www.sabrent.com/product/DS-SKRT-D2TB/ds-skrt-d2tb/\">$499.99 on Sabrent’s site</a>, opting for the full 16TB of storage sets you back an <a href=\"https://www.sabrent.com/product/DS-SKRT-D16TB/ds-skrt-d16tb/\">eye-watering $2,900</a>.</p><p id=\"eGYOBS\">That sounds like a lot, but Sabrent’s dock is combining two computer accessories that are already relatively pricey when sold individually. One of the best-regarded Thunderbolt 3 docks on the market, <a href=\"https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/\">Caldigit’s TS3 Plus</a>, typically retails for between $250 and $300 and doesn’t include any extra storage. And 2TB of external storage can easily cost upwards of $200 depending on the specifications you need. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P50ZpfQpYJp4PNQ1zpTdl2Gc380=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23312875/71_hqa5nLCL.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Sabrent</cite>      <figcaption><em>The dock’s ports.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"RdaKZ7\">It’s a shame that Sabrent’s new dock doesn’t support the newer Thunderbolt 4 standard, but the company <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2022/03/10/sabrents-new-thunderbolt-dock-features-a-16tb-ssd-and-tons-of-ports/\">tells <em>PetaPixel</em></a> that the global chip shortage made it too difficult to acquire Thunderbolt 4-capable chips. That means it misses out on more advanced features like being able to power an 8K display at 60Hz.</p><p id=\"UKkSNY\">But the rest of Sabrent’s dock’s specs are respectable. There are a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports on its rear, and it can provide up to 96W of power to an attached laptop. You also get Gigabit Ethernet, DisplayPort 1.4, and two USB Type-A ports on its rear. Around front, there’s a pair of 3.5mm jacks for headphones and mics, an SD card slot (with UHS-II speeds for you port nerds out there), a Type-C USB port, and a third Type-A port.</p><p id=\"lesXa7\">Sabrent’s new dock is available to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RS9Q7WZ?linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=peta0c-20&amp;linkId=3a8dc6ca25aa61523683d7aa2e6a3b44&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;th=1\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">order on Amazon now</a>.</p>",
