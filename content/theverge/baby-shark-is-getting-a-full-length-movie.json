But the upcoming film appears to be a more traditional full-blow theatrical release, which is an impressive jump for the 2-minute, 16-second YouTube video. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"SnlgPW\"><q>Baby Shark swims to a full-length film</q></aside></div><p id=\"CVc1wy\">There are virtually no details on what the Baby Shark movie (which is set to be co-produced by Nickelodeon Animation and the Pinkfong Company) will entail. Presumably, it’ll have songs that will almost certainly get stuck in your (or your child’s) head for eternity. </p><p id=\"teqddI\">The original “Baby Shark” video became the first <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881970/baby-shark-youtube-video-10-billion-views\">YouTube video to cross the 10 billion view mark</a> last month, and it has already gotten a TV show spinoff (<em>Baby Shark’s Big Show</em>), in addition to the newly announced film. </p><p id=\"gRt8wA\">The news of a Baby Shark movie comes among a huge slate of announcements for Paramount Plus, including a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/15/22936201/halo-tv-show-paramount-plus-season-two-renewed\">second season of the upcoming <em>Halo</em> TV series</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/15/22936219/paramount-plus-knuckles-tv-show-series-sonic-third-movie\">an Idris Elba-led Knuckles series</a> based on the live-action <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> movies. </p><p id=\"kpctsF\"></p>",
