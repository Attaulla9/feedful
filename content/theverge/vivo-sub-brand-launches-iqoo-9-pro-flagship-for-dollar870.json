Like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21224697/iqoo-3-5g-gaming-phone-specs-price-india\">previous iQOO devices</a>, they don’t really look like conspicuously gamer-style phones but are focused on performance nonetheless. iQOO is pushing that in its marketing through a tie-in partnership with BMW M Motorsport and a white model with three rally stripes.</p><p id=\"I1OMeH\">The iQOO 9 Pro has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, up to 12GB of RAM, and a 4,700mAh battery. The screen is a 6.78-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED panel, while the camera system includes a 50-megapixel ultrawide, a 16-megapixel portrait camera, and a 50-megapixel main sensor that uses gimbal-style stabilization, like other Vivo flagships. It can be charged at 120W with a cable or, still unusually for a Vivo-adjacent phone, with wireless charging at up to 50W.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4RzusSt_st2qjM2k_b3Jr6aoNoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23264886/6._iQOO_9_Legend.jpg\">      <figcaption>The iQOO 9.</figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"Ye0miN\">Differences in the non-Pro iQOO 9 include a Snapdragon 888 Plus processor, a 4,350mAh battery, and a 6.56-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED screen. The smaller camera bump houses a 48-megapixel main camera, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 13-megapixel portrait camera. The phone still has 120W wired charging, but there’s no wireless option. Both the iQOO 9 and 9 Pro run Vivo’s Funtouch OS 12, based on Android 12.</p><p id=\"gfmeJa\">In India, the iQOO 9 Pro will cost Rs. 64,990 (~$870) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, or Rs. 69,990 (~$940) for 12GB/256GB. The iQOO 9 is Rs. 42,990 (~$580) for 8GB/128GB and Rs. 46,990 (~$630) for 12GB/256GB. The phones will be available from March 2nd.</p>",
