Last week, <a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/a-recent-entrance-to-paradise.pdf\">a three-person board reviewed</a> a 2019 ruling against Steven Thaler, who tried to copyright a picture on behalf of an algorithm he dubbed Creativity Machine. The board found that Thaler’s AI-created image didn’t include an element of “human authorship” — a necessary standard, it said, for protection.</p><p id=\"aXbc3S\">Creativity Machine’s work, seen above, is named “A Recent Entrance to Paradise.” It’s part of a series <a href=\"https://www.urbasm.com/2016/05/artificial-intelligence-visions-art-of-a-dying-brain/\">Thaler has described</a> as a “simulated near-death experience” in which an algorithm reprocesses pictures to create hallucinatory images and a fictional narrative about the afterlife. Crucially, the AI is supposed to do this with extremely minimal human intervention, which has proven a dealbreaker for the Copyright Office.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"MRjz0H\"><q>“Courts have been consistent in finding that non-human expression is ineligible for copyright protection”</q></aside></div><p id=\"BZDZ2A\">The board’s decision calls “the nexus between the human mind and creative expression” a vital element of copyright. As it notes, copyright law doesn’t directly outline rules for non-humans, but courts have taken a dim view of claims that animals or divine beings can take advantage of copyright protections. A 1997 decision says that a book of (supposed) <a href=\"https://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/gender-sexuality/Ventimiglia_Paper.pdf\">divine revelations</a>, for instance, could be protected if there was (again, supposedly) an element of human arrangement and curation. More recently, a court found that a monkey <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17271410/monkey-selfie-naruto-slater-copyright-peta\">couldn’t sue for copyright infringement</a>. “The courts have been consistent in finding that non-human expression is ineligible for copyright protection,” the board says.</p><p id=\"xduVAg\">This doesn’t necessarily mean <em>any</em> art with an AI component is ineligible. Thaler emphasized that humans weren’t meaningfully involved because his goal was to prove that machine-created works could receive protection, not simply to stop people from infringing on the picture. (He’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22656039/ai-inventor-patent-copyright-uspto-federal-court-ruling\">unsuccessfully tried</a> to establish that AIs can patent inventions in the US as well.) The board’s reasoning takes his explanation for granted. So if someone tried to copyright a similar work by arguing it was a product of their own creativity executed by a machine, the outcome might look different. A court could also reach an alternate conclusion on Thaler’s work if he follows his rejection with a lawsuit.</p><p id=\"oqCC8R\">Even so, the Copyright Office is highlighting the importance of human agency in machine-produced works. As AI becomes <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18299563/ai-algorithm-music-law-copyright-human\">a bigger part</a> of artists’ repertoires, the limits of that conclusion could be tested for years to come.</p>",
