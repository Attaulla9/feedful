The company’s marketing team seems to favor word mash-ups like BlueCruise, ActiveGlide, FordPass, PowerBoost, EcoBoost, EcoSport, and more.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"sPzgDm\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"in\" dir=\"ltr\">VIDEO Pt2: Smaht pahk - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hyundai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Hyundai</a> Santa Fe Hybrid. Oakland Co lot, MI <a href=\"https://twitter.com/detroitnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DetroitNews</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/OyDOeAifrG\">pic.twitter.com/OyDOeAifrG</a></p>— Henry Payne (@HenryEPayne) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HenryEPayne/status/1438575904565911554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 16, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></div><p id=\"2oq8m1\">Remote parking promises a future with the ability to park a car in a tight garage or parking space without fear of getting stuck in the cabin. Hyundai most recently came out with such a feature using just the key fob called Smart Park (aka <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBvkmWDjsYc\">Smaht Park</a>).</p><p id=\"gzhSfK\">Hyundai, Ford, and even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/24/22899010/thor-vision-airstream-estream-battery-powered-motorhome-rv\">RV companies</a> are following in the steps of Tesla’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929438/tesla-smart-summon-use-one-million-q3-2019\">quite popular</a> Summon feature, which was a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/9/10742926/tesla-model-s-update-self-parking\">feature</a> that could back itself out of a garage. But the perpetually beta Tesla software caused <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/11/11656496/tesla-model-s-autonomous-summon-mode-crash\">unintended collisions</a> early on, and the later-upgraded “Smart Summon” feature that is supposed to autonomously come to you while dodging people and shopping carts in a parking lot also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20891343/tesla-smart-summon-feature-videos-parking-accidents\">had troubles</a>.</p><p id=\"Am4Vt8\">Ford is much more conservative in its approach to technology. The automaker’s next-gen advanced driver assistance system, BlueCruise, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750476/ford-hands-free-bluecruise-2022-delay-adas-farley\">was delayed</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video\">Mustang Mach-E</a>. There’s no indication as to when its smart parking feature would also be released.</p>",
