Musk is also seeking to block <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/7/22921648/tesla-sec-elon-musk-subpoena-tweet-poll-shares\">an SEC subpoena related to his tweets about selling 10 percent of his stake in Tesla</a>. </p><p id=\"yYeDMH\">Musk sent the notorious tweet on August 7th, 2018, in which he claimed to have the funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share. (Tesla has been a publicly traded company since 2010.)</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"KXM8te\"><q>“trample on Mr. Musk’s First Amendment rights”</q></aside></div><p id=\"fWG7pC\">The SEC immediately launched an investigation, eventually concluding that, while he had held a few meetings with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, Musk “had never discussed a going-private transaction at $420 per share with any potential funding source, had done nothing to investigate whether it would be possible for all current investors to remain with Tesla as a private company via a ‘special purpose fund,’ and had not confirmed support of Tesla’s investors for a potential going-private transaction.”</p><div id=\"TgYhSK\"><p >   <a title=\"View Elon Musk court filing about the SEC on Scribd\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F563388694%2FElon-Musk-court-filing-about-the-SEC%23from_embed&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F8%2F22967122%2Felon-musk-tesla-sec-tweet-court-subpoena-investigation\"  rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk court filing about the SEC</a> by <a title=\"View ahawkins8223's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fuser%2F112638498%2Fahawkins8223%23from_embed&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F8%2F22967122%2Felon-musk-tesla-sec-tweet-court-subpoena-investigation\"  rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ahawkins8223</a> on Scribd</p><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Elon Musk court filing about the SEC\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/563388694/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-gJs8wjXEQllMrIZoM5vi\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.75\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_96406\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div><p id=\"b5mUGM\">But in a new court filing Tuesday, Musk claims that “funding <em>was</em> secured, and there <em>was </em>investor support.” He said that he felt pressure to settle the issue with the SEC or risk Tesla’s financial security. </p><p id=\"OF6oBl\">“Despite this, the SEC’s unrelenting regulatory pressure, combined with the attendant collateral consequence of the SEC’s complaint against me, caused a scenario in which I was forced to sign the consent decree in 2018,” Musk said. “Tesla was a less mature company and the SEC’s action stood to jeopardize the company’s financing.”</p><p id=\"zkCxCN\">Musk said he was planning on signing the decree until he learned it could negatively affect his other companies — Space X, Neuralink, and The Boring Company — as well. He said he tried to get out of it but ultimately relented after the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet\">SEC sued him for securities fraud</a> and several major Tesla shareholders threatened to sell their stake in the company. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"PL8eNF\"><q>“funding <em>was</em> secured, and there <em>was </em>investor support.”</q></aside></div><p id=\"MR89NS\">“I had only wanted to settle to help Tesla, but I did not wish to cause harm to the other companies,” Musk said. “It felt wrong to do so.”</p><p id=\"6gk5VF\">The SEC is investigating whether recent stock sales by Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949453/tesla-elon-musk-kimbal-sec-investigation-insider-trading\">potentially violated insider trading rules</a>. The investigation began late last year after Musk and his brother sold $108 million worth of Tesla shares, according to <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. That sale happened the day before Elon Musk polled his Twitter followers about whether he should sell 10 percent of his stake in the company — and promised to abide by the poll’s results.</p><p id=\"iMHktj\">In this week’s filing, Musk defended his actions while his lawyers seek to quash the agency’s subpoena. “I never lied to shareholders,” Musk writes. “I would never lie to shareholders. I entered into the consent decree for the survival of Tesla, for the sake of its shareholders.”</p><p id=\"4CC2Jj\">Musk’s conflict with the SEC has flared up in recent weeks. The billionaire CEO accused the agency of subjecting <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/17/22938823/elon-musk-sec-investigation-free-speech-tesla\">him and his company to “endless, unfounded investigations</a>.” He also alleged that the agency was ignoring its commitment to distribute $40 million in fine money to Tesla shareholders, as per the 2018 settlement. And he claimed that the SEC was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/22/22946117/elon-musk-sec-accuse-leak-information-tesla\">leaking information</a> regarding federal investigations without providing any specific evidence to back his claim.</p>",
