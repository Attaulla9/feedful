It costs $800 at Newegg (via <a href=\"https://slickdeals.net/f/15628597-aorus-fo48u-48-widescreen-oled-4k-premium-gaming-monitor-799-99-after-rebate?prop=rcmid-44b4c77446f98a84a1cd7c732354ddda&amp;src=foryou_recombee\"><em>Slickdeals</em></a>), but two steps are required to get this price. First off, enter the code <strong>FEB4SALE</strong> at the checkout page to knock $200 off the cost. <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=vergedailydeals022222&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2FN82E16824716003\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">You’ll pay $999.99 today</a>. But make sure you fill out the <a href=\"https://images10.newegg.com/uploadfilesfornewegg/rebate/SH/Gigabyte4MIRsFeb01Feb2822jd56.pdf\">mail-in rebate</a> before March 29th, 2022, which will then take an additional $200 off (the rebate will come in the form of a prepaid card).</p><p id=\"vHJLIY\">While Gigabyte certainly doesn’t have the same (or, frankly, any) brand cache in the home entertainment space as LG, this model packs in many of the same specs as the coveted C1 OLED for a few hundred dollars less. It has two HDMI 2.1 ports that support up to 4K resolution at 120Hz, which you’ll likely want for gaming on your high-end PC or an Xbox Series X and PS5. That gives the Gigabyte model the edge over LG’s similarly priced A1 OLED, which tops out at 60Hz and lacks HDMI 2.1 ports. And despite having its roots in gaming, the front of Gigabyte’s OLED doesn’t have any garish design features.</p><p id=\"lr1Mv7\">We haven’t tested out this model, but if you want to learn more, I suggest checking out the <a href=\"https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/gigabyte/aorus-fo48u-oled\"><em>Rtings </em>review</a>.</p><div id=\"IBs1e8\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11061738\"></div></div><div id=\"Ckskmj\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra review: duly noted|106064\" data-volume-uuid=\"7cdddef0e\" data-volume-id=\"106064\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-458\" class=\"volume-video\" data-volume-player-choice=\"youtube\"></div></div><p id=\"7bVPtv\">Samsung’s Galaxy S22 devices will launch on Friday, February 25th, and time is running out to place a preorder. Your last day to preorder and get in on all of the associated promotions is Thursday (at 11:59PM ET). If you need a reminder of all the stuff you get for preordering, that’s why I’m here. </p><p id=\"oTlRPf\">No matter which phone you get in the lineup (the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1765650459869010594\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">S22</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1765650460981078839\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">S22 Plus</a>, or <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1765650461960167884\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">S22 Ultra</a>), your choice of phone will get a free (yep, totally free) upgrade to the next tier of storage. For instance, the 128GB S22 becomes the 256GB S22 just because you preordered. Also, you’ll get up to $200 in Samsung credit (the S22 Plus and S22 will net less) for use on other Samsung gadgets at its online store. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22923423/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-ultra-buy-preorder-price-release-date\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">We’ve got more details here, including carrier promos.</a></p><div id=\"cFtFR6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11037901\"></div></div><div id=\"SDAbn9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11037915\"></div></div><p id=\"a99xl5\">Razer’s multitalented Naga Pro wireless gaming mouse is $50 off at Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B08D27XXRY/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">costing $99.99</a>. Its highlight feature is its ability to swap side buttons depending on your needs or your favorite kinds of games. It includes three magnetically attaching plates, one that features the Naga’s signature 12-button array, ideal for MMOs or other genres that could benefit from mapping several buttons to a mouse. There’s also a six-button panel included, and finally, there’s a two-button attachment. Each of these plates can be configured to your liking within Razer Synapse.</p><p id=\"pwM44r\">The Naga Pro supports 2.4GHz wireless, as well as Bluetooth. Razer says it should deliver up to 150 hours of use via Bluetooth or 100 hours using its wireless receiver. My biggest knock against this model is that it charges via Micro USB. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418172/razer-naga-pro-wireless-gaming-mouse-mmo-moba-battle-royale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read our coverage here.</a></p><div id=\"JYQizE\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11061767\"></div></div><p id=\"Dmc1AI\">If you want to play <em>Elden Ring</em> right at launch, PC players can get a special preorder discount at Green Man Gaming. The game normally costs $59.99, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Felden-ring-pc%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F22%2F22945533%2Fgigabyte-oled-tv-samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-preorder-elden-ring-razer-gaming-mouse-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">but you can snag a Steam code for just $50.39</a>. The highly anticipated game by FromSoftware launches Friday, February 25th, a date that fans of <em>Dark Souls </em>and <em>Bloodborne</em> fanatics have probably been saying in their sleep. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774836/elden-ring-fromsoftware-hands-on-preview\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read our spoiler-free preview coverage right here for a taste of what to expect.</a></p><div id=\"217tyL\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11061778\"></div></div><aside id=\"q3gthG\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
