A power outage tracker monitoring the region also said that it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PowerOutage_com/status/1499453835814789124\">no longer receiving data</a> for Sumy Oblast.</p><p id=\"RoI1wl\">Sumy Oblast is one of 24 administrative regions, known as “oblasts,” that make up Ukraine and has a population of roughly one million people.</p><div id=\"Ntz3wI\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">⚠️ Confirmed: A telecoms blackout has just been registered across <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sumy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Sumy</a> Oblast, north-eastern <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Ukraine</a>, as residents report massive blasts at the thermal power plant and electrical substation that turned the sky 'yellow and red' for miles.<br><br>  Background: <a href=\"https://t.co/S0qJQ7CbNv\">https://t.co/S0qJQ7CbNv</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zNG42jfbIS\">pic.twitter.com/zNG42jfbIS</a></p>— NetBlocks (@netblocks) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1499450451779010571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 3, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"4SkbhF\">Social media users reported that explosions had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Liza22Frank/status/1499449813829623811\">damaged the combined heat and power (CHP) plant</a> in Sumy, resulting in a loss of heat, water and electricity. A video shared by a journalist from the Indian<em> Deccan Herald</em> newspaper reported to show <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shemin_joy/status/1499451059252899840\">Indian students sheltering from bombardment</a> in the region and appeared to confirm details of the explosion and power cut. The city of Sumy has been a particular focus of media coverage in India after it emerged that an estimated 600-700 Indian students at Sumy State University <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/we-are-traumatised-indian-embassy-officials-not-reachable-says-student-from-sumy-7799734/\">were stranded and unable to leave</a>. </p><p id=\"etY1NA\">The communications blackout in Sumy Oblast is the most serious outage since the Russian invasion began and appears to be on a larger scale than incidents reported in Kharkiv and Kyiv. On February 23rd, areas of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949115/internet-disruptions-ukraine-kharkiv-russia\">Kharkiv and the surrounding region lost connectivity</a> after infrastructure belonging to the internet service provider Triolan was damaged, although internet services were mostly restored shortly afterward.</p><p id=\"QiHkW8\">While some analysts have expressed fears of a more widespread internet outage, it has so far failed to materialize. Some Ukrainians are now <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22956481/ukraine-spacex-starlink-oleg-krutkov-dish-internet-russia-invasion\">able to access satellite internet through SpaceX’s Starlink service</a> after Ukraine’s vice prime minister tweeted to Elon Musk requesting that the service be extended to cover the country. </p>",
