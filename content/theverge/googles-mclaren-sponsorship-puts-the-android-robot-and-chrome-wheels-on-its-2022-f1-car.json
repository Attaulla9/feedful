As noted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.formula1.com%2Fen%2Flatest%2Farticle.2021-vs-2022-whats-changed-on-formula-1s-all-new-cars-for-this-season.1SrJj7fQgv4Iw2IxCTnb1l.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F16%2F22981140%2Fmclaren-f1-android-chrome-google-mcl36-sponsor-2022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Formula1.com</a>, the covers are a mandatory addition to all cars this season, and while they have a simpler design than the ones seen on some cars in the mid-00s, they’re part of the changes instituted to lower turbulence created by each car to enable closer following and, ideally, more passing opportunities. <a href=\"https://us.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-tech-wheel-rim-covers-2022/7078252/\">Motorsport.com</a> has more information on the history of wheel covers in F1, why they were banned prior to the 2010 season, and why they’re back now, including a not that the dished design is supposed to make them easier for mechanics to handle during pit stops.</p><p id=\"FFsZbk\">They also say that McLaren will use “5G-enabled Android devices and Chrome browser across its operations during practice sessions, qualifying and races to support the drivers and team, with the goal of improving on-track performance.” In a statement, Brown said “By integrating platforms like Android and Chrome across our operations, our team will be better supported to focus on driving performance. We’re looking forward to an exciting partnership that spans across Formula 1 and Extreme E.”</p><aside id=\"1LUIbY\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"In Formula 1, you have to be amazing just to be average\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17499438/formula1-french-grand-prix-behind-the-scenes\"},{\"title\":\"Inside Mercedes’ top-secret Formula 1 engine factory\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/18/11031456/mercedes-formula-one-engine-design-specs-engineering\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"OWYQTv\">As a viewer, the inclusion is less annoying than the race broadcast’s often-useless “Insights powered by AWS” sponsored by Amazon, but as Microsoft has found out with its Surface and the NFL, the real branding opportunity comes <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/8/9693380/the-packers-are-terrible-aaron-rodgers-surface\">when someone decides to spike your equipment</a>.</p><p id=\"eAej8M\"><em><strong>Update March 17th, 1:47AM ET:</strong></em><em> Added additional pictures of the MCL36 and information about wheel covers for the 2022 F1 cars.</em></p>",
