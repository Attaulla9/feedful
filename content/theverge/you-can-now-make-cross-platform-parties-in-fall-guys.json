As part of the game’s season 6 mid-season update, you can now make cross-platform parties in “any of our applicable playlists in Fall Guys—from Squads, to Duos, to Main Show and beyond,” <a href=\"https://www.fallguys.com/en-US/news/season-6-mid-season-update\">Mediatonic said in a blog post</a>.</p><p id=\"8NzJQ2\">To party up with your friends, you have to link your Epic Account to <em>Fall Guys</em>. If you haven’t done that yet, Mediatonic says you’ll be prompted to do so when you launch the game.</p><p id=\"UVY3oS\">The feature builds on the previously more limited crossplay functionality in the game. Before now, players <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fallguysgame/status/1392524989102972936?lang=en\">had to make custom lobbies</a> to play with friends on different platforms. Mediatonic also allowed you to play against people other platforms via matchmaking, but you couldn’t join parties with them. </p><p id=\"OXbi0j\">Crossplay is a signature feature of two of Epic’s other big titles, <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket League</em>, so it’s not surprising to see that Epic is making it easier to take advantage of in <em>Fall Guys</em>. While it’s a clear benefit for users, connecting players across platforms can be fraught from a business perspective: Sony was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15807138/sony-playstation-cross-network-play-xbox-block-response\">strongly</a> <a href=\"https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/51c4c555-9b8c-4664-a22b-49666aa56c21#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony%2Dps4%2Dcross%2Dplay%2Dconfidential%2Ddocuments%2Depic%2Dgames%2Dagreements\">opposed</a> to enabling the feature for <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, but it eventually backed down on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17905146/sony-fortnite-ps4-cross-play-support\">both</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182389/rocket-league-cross-play-enabled-ps4-switch-xbox-pc\">games</a> following player demands.</p><p id=\"KGKd49\">It’s unclear if the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288187/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-nintendo-switch-mediatonic\">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289166/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-xbox-series-x-s-one-announced\">Xbox</a> versions of <em>Fall Guys</em> will support crossplay as well. But given Epic’s history, it seems like a possibility we’ll see the feature on those platforms. Mediatonic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. </p>",
