It was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319251/sonos-roam-pricing-features-release-date\">initially</a> priced at $169, but Sonos <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667044/sonos-speaker-price-increases-announce-september-12\">cited the global chip shortage as a reason</a> for bumping the price up to $179 last fall. If you were interested in the product but want to save a few bucks, Sonos is now introducing the Roam SL, a mic-less version that costs $159, and mimics the similarly mic-less <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849821/sonos-one-sl-port-price-specs-features-announcement\">One SL</a> it released two years ago.</p><p id=\"bneCu2\">According to the FAQ, losing the microphone doesn’t just cut out support for either voice assistant. It also means no <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22317082/sonos-roam-features-trueplay-sound-swap-leak-specs-price\">automated Trueplay sound tuning</a>, and living without the Sound Swap feature that lets you pass off audio from the Roam to a nearby Sonos speaker by holding down the play button.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v0nlcHIN40xMkR4JK-5b5S0i1vs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23279747/sonos_roam_sl.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Sonos</cite>  </figure><p id=\"IEpqrj\">While the Roam doesn’t support pairing over Bluetooth, the Roam SL supports stereo pairing with another Roam SL or the original Roam speaker when you’re streaming music via Wi-Fi. That could come in handy if you just don’t need to talk to a voice assistant while playing music at the beach or by the pool this summer, or if you’re simply purchasing a second speaker to pair with your original one. It’s also still compatible with the optional $49 wireless charger Sonos sells, or any Qi-certified wireless charging pad.</p><p id=\"ooKbES\">Everything else appears to be the same for a compact speaker that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features\">we enjoyed despite some limitations when we reviewed it last spring</a>. It still has an 18WH battery with 10 hours of continuous playback, a quad-core 1.4GHz CPU, IP67 waterproof certification, and Apple AirPlay 2 compatibility. Preorders are available now from <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/roam-sl#3\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sonos</a>, with shipments scheduled to begin on March 15th.</p>",
