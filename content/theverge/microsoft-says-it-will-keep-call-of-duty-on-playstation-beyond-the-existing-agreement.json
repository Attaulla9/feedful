Last month, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/activision-s-next-few-call-of-duty-games-will-be-on-playstation\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported that Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch\">pledged to bring “the next few” <em>Call of Duty</em> games</a> to PlayStation “for at least two years” before the acquisition was made public.</p><aside id=\"ZTUtOy\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"A guide to Microsoft’s Xbox game studios empire \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890225/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-aqcuisition-game-studios\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"R3MBNK\">After those two years pass, it’s up to Microsoft to decide if it wants to continue releasing <em>Call of Duty</em> (and likely other cross-platform Activision Blizzard games) on PlayStation. Microsoft has said it expects the deal to close in the next six to 18 months, which means we may not hear a final answer regarding the exclusivity of the games for quite some time.</p><p id=\"5C5565\">While <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893830/microsoft-gaming-ceo-xbox-phil-spencer-keep-call-of-duty-playstation\">Microsoft is certainly making it seem like</a> it wants to keep Activision Blizzard titles cross-platform, existing precedents have indicated otherwise. After <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass\">Microsoft acquired Bethesda last year</a>, it promised to retain existing contractual agreements with PlayStation, such as with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc\"><em>Deathloop</em></a>, but still released Bethesda titles, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532181/redfall-arkane-studios-co-op-vampire-shooter-xbox\"><em>Redfall</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release\"><em>Starfield</em> as Xbox and PC exclusives</a>.</p><aside id=\"Jt6xI6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Sony expects Microsoft to ‘continue to ensure’ Activision games stay multiplatform \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892860/sony-microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-comment-response\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"s214tB\">In its announcement, Microsoft also said it plans on “taking similar steps to support Nintendo’s successful platform.” The announcement comes as Microsoft plans to introduce Open App Store Principles, which Microsoft says will promote competition in app stores as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22914479/open-app-markets-act-legislation-senate-committee-markup-explained\">regulators close in anticompetitive behavior</a>.</p><p id=\"Aaei2k\">There’s one notable exception to its Open App Store plans, however — the Xbox Store. According to Microsoft, “Gaming consoles, specifically, are sold to gamers at a loss to establish a robust and viable ecosystem for game developers. The costs are recovered later through revenue earned in the dedicated console store.” The principles laid out will not apply “immediately and wholesale” on Xbox, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22925591/microsoft-xbox-store-open-policies-business-model-changes-hints\">the company referred to “closing the gap”</a> between reality and its stated principles without giving a clear timeline.</p>",
