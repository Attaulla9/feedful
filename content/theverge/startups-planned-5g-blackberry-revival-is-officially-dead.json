But at the time there was speculation that the company might live on and attempt to produce a 5G keyboard-equipped Android phone without the Blackberry name. Now, however, we know it’s the end of the line for the company as a whole as well as the product itself.</p><p id=\"twClZQ\">Despite saying “this is not the outcome we worked and hoped for,” OnwardMobility’s statement doesn’t give any indication of exactly why it cancelled the project. But <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/the-5g-blackberry-is-dead/\"><em>Android Police</em> previously reported</a> that its license to use the Blackberry branding had recently been cancelled. And, more generally, it can’t have been easy trying to make it as a new smartphone manufacturer amidst an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping\">global chip shortage</a>. </p>",
