What’s also easy to imagine, though, is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest\">Apple</a> being very particular about what sorts of stories about <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/\">labor violations</a> in tech it wants on its streaming platform.</p>",
