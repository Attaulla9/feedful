The image shows a microphone icon in the Twitter app’s bottom menu bar, which appears to lead to a page titled “Podcasts.”</p><div id=\"FnjY7v\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Twitter is working on Podcasts tab <a href=\"https://t.co/64tTd3XPdu\">pic.twitter.com/64tTd3XPdu</a></p>— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1499110065147551745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 2, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"B4aEEJ\">The screenshot doesn’t show any indication of how podcasts could be displayed on the platform or if it’ll somehow incorporate Spaces, the platform’s audio-only chatrooms. Right now, live Spaces are stuffed at the top of Twitter feeds, and it would make sense to organize them into a separate tab. </p><p id=\"9mXFUc\">Twitter began branching out to audio when it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms\">first launched Spaces in 2020</a> and dove even deeper into the medium with its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/\">acquisition of social podcast platform Breaker</a>. Spaces has been an ongoing project for the platform, which recently started <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces\">letting anyone create chatrooms</a> and allowing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22882479/twitter-spaces-recordings-ios-android\">all mobile users to record conversations</a>. </p><p id=\"hxHeE1\">Recorded Spaces are already a bit like podcasts, albeit only temporary ones, which only last 30 days. If a Twitter podcast feature is anything like Spotify or Apple Podcasts, users would be able to choose from and listen to podcasts at their leisure, with no rush to catch a live Spaces broadcast or listen to recordings before time runs out.</p><p id=\"6v1N9h\">As social platforms look toward adding more features to potentially drive more revenue, Twitter is just the latest to possibly grow another arm to support podcasts. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537023/facebook-podcast-rss-feed-publish-clips-pages\">Facebook launched a podcast feature</a> for select creators, while <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22925935/reddit-clubhouse-clone-recordings-web-features\">Reddit just enabled recording</a> for its audio-only Talks. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Twitter with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.</p>",
