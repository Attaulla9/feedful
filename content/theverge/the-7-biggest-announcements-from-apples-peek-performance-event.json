If you’re looking for a quick round-up, here are the biggest announcements Apple made in its hour-long presentation.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4YFpEoi8ctlRqsy45xKEg0_Z0ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298711/lcimg_81d8f753_d066_4188_b9c0_4dc86fe9b86f.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Apple</cite>      <figcaption><em>Apple now has four chips in its M1 lineup.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"KSNTT4\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22958174/apple-silicon-m1-ultra-chip-soc-processor-cpu-gpu-update\">Apple M1 Ultra</a></h2><p id=\"n5Zszt\">Apple announced a new addition to its Apple Silicon lineup, with the M1 Ultra. The TL;DR is that it’s basically two M1 Max chips put together, supporting up to 128GB of RAM. Apple says it’s eight times faster than the standard M1 chip. The M1 Ultra will be available in the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22962081/apple-mac-studio-m1-max-ultra-price-specs-processor-release-date\">Mac Studio</a> and likely in the Mac Pro that Apple teased as an upcoming announcement.

The M1 Max version starts at $1,999, and the M1 Ultra version <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22962052/apple-studio-display-specs-price-release-date\">starts at $3,999</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mBglrFc76J1_YwPs23I7Yl6DFmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298785/2022_3_8_apple_293_10_31_49_800.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Apple</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Studio Display is significantly less expensive than the Pro Display XDR.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"wotntX\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22962052/apple-studio-display-specs-price-release-date\">Apple’s 27-inch 5K Studio Display costs $1,599, and it has an iPhone chip inside</a></h2><p id=\"RxHNfR\">The Studio Display has a 27-inch, 5K screen encased in an aluminum enclosure. The display can reach up to 600 nits of brightness, supports P3 wide color, and also works with macOS’s TrueTone feature. Above the screen is a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for video conferencing. Apple’s first new prosumer monitor in years is available to order now, with shipments starting on March 18th.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"iPhone SE (2022)\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RHVTFHbuNpuOaz3ljjNsWOjw2xs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298760/2022_03_08_10_10_09_dbd7VzRIvv_800.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Apple</cite>      <figcaption><em>The iPhone SE is getting a speed bump, but is keeping the tried-and-true design.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"HFI0jy\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22959072/iphone-se-3-price-screen-specs-features-release-date-a15-bionic-5g\">Apple’s new iPhone SE has 5G and an A15 Bionic CPU</a></h2><p id=\"DyGHMX\">The new iPhone SE brings the advanced features of Apple’s newest A15 CPU to a cheaper, smaller package with a price that starts at $429. Apple seemed to downplay the SE’s new 5G radio and instead focused on the fact that you can get an experience similar to its pricier iPhone 13 devices in the same 4.7-inch package — including Touch ID — when it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22961680/apple-ipad-air-2022-release-date-price-features-specs-m1\">launches on March 18th.</a></p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n6qmPqdkBrHJpOj5BK_23aZgADM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23298765/2022_3_8_apple_115_10_36_16_800.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Apple</cite>      <figcaption><em>The iPad Air now has the Mac’s processor.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"HJVBKr\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22961680/apple-ipad-air-2022-release-date-price-features-specs-m1\">The new iPad Air has an M1 chip inside</a></h2><p id=\"TDs1JH\">A year and a half after its last update, the iPad Air has another new version, but this time, the improvements are mostly internal. Now it’s home to an eight-core M1 chip like the iPad Pro, 5G on cellular-equipped models, and a 12MP front-facing camera.</p><h2 id=\"pw2fjB\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967483/apple-tv-plus-friday-night-baseball\">Apple TV Plus announces Friday Night Baseball</a></h2><p id=\"AoIbjL\">Apple’s streaming service will feature two Major League Baseball games on Friday nights during the regular season.
