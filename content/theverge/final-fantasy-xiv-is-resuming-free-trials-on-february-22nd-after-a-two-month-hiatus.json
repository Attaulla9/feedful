The trial doesn’t actually include access to the latest expansion. But the game’s servers couldn’t adequately support the combination of people rushing in to play the new content and a fresh wave of new players looking to check out what the hype was all about. Queue lines got so long that Square Enix was forced to both temporarily stop selling the game and get rid of its free trial in an effort to make sure that existing players could get in. And while sales of the game resumed in January, the free trial had still been absent until now.</p>",
