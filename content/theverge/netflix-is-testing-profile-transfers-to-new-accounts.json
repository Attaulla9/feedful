As described in a post on <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/paying-to-share-netflix-outside-your-household\">Netflix’s site</a>, this feature — and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981283/netflix-password-sharing-test-multiple-streams\">another that enables you to add sub-accounts</a> for people you don’t live with — is currently being tested in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru.</p><p id=\"foUVmo\">Netflix notes that users can transfer profiles to new accounts, or the sub-accounts that subscribers will have to pay an additional fee for. This lets users retain their viewing history, My List, and recommendations when they complete the transfer to a new account. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/1/4563718/netflix-multiple-user-profiles\">Netflix first rolled out user profiles</a> in 2013, which serve as a way to split up watch histories among friends and family members using a single account.</p><p id=\"xeTzGS\">Last year, Netflix rolled out a test as an attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325831/netflix-password-sharing-test-feature-piracy-security-streaming-video\">cut down on password sharing</a>, which required users to verify account ownership in order to gain access to their accounts. This new test seems to be a way for Netflix to nudge moochers into buying their own subscriptions — or at least for account owners to pay up for anyone using the service outside their households.</p><p id=\"g1ScOK\"><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong></em><em> </em>The Verge<em> is currently producing a series with Netflix.</em></p>",
