Following some <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/11/22929356/twitter-down-outage-west-coast\">problems last Friday</a>, the social network experienced some issues on Thursday as well. It doesn’t seem to be a full-on outage, but there were a handful of small issues.</p><p id=\"76HQIe\">I was having trouble loading tweets on profiles in my browser, and a few <em>Verge</em> staffers noticed problems as well. App researcher Jane Manchun Wong chronicled a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1494347084199514113\">couple</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1494351929773727745\">issues</a>, but said Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1494354196262715392\">made a change to mitigate things</a>. </p><p id=\"3d88Vx\">Twitter confirmed there was an issue Thursday in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Earlier today, we experienced a technical bug that briefly impacted how Tweets were loading for people on Twitter,” company spokesperson Shaokyi Amdo said. “This issue has since been resolved.”</p><p id=\"Cnh2bO\">Earlier on Thursday, Downdetector <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/\">showed a spike</a> in user reports of problems, but the volume of reports appears to have dramatically fallen. Outage map screenshots taken an hour apart indicate things might have been worst for those near New York City and Washington, DC. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgDYybLOfjriuHvdBEYyUERMiXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23252332/Screen_Shot_2022_02_17_at_8.51.26_AM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters</cite>      <figcaption><em>Downdetector’s outage map as of 11:51AM ET.</em></figcaption>  </figure>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fOziut7WXBnZDbbx6HTrPplWWhA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23252459/Screen_Shot_2022_02_17_at_9.52.33_AM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters</cite>      <figcaption><em>And as of 9:52AM ET.</em></figcaption>  </figure><aside id=\"siW7XC\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Twitter says its Friday problems are fixed\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/11/22929356/twitter-down-outage-west-coast\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"wX4ZZI\"><em><strong>Update February 17th, 2:20PM ET</strong></em><em>: Added statement from Twitter.</em></p>",
