Unlike the base AirPods, the latest Pros offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS and a MagSafe-compatible charging case.</p><p id=\"ftMREv\">While the AirPods Pro carry a lofty $249.99 price tag, they also go on sale rather frequently. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, for instance, we saw them drop as low as $160.

The earbuds blend a bit of the AirPods Pro look with the hard, plastic build of the second-gen model and come with a MagSafe-compatible charging case.

These affordable earbuds came out at the end of 2021, and they prove their worth with good sound quality, excellent battery life, and very aggressive pricing. You may not get active noise cancellation or wireless charging with these earbuds, but they remain an exceptional value.

We were slightly disappointed by the lack of true active noise cancellation, but we’re happy to report that, thanks to a firmware update, the Jabra Elite 75t now include this feature.</p><p id=\"Z7NLcY\">Normally $149.99, the Jabra Elite 75t wireless earbuds are currently on sale at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgDFH0NZb1E\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJabra-Elite-75t-True-Wireless-Earbuds-Noise-Cancelling-Titanium-Black%2F614278180%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227000000000%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D42423897272%26wl4%3Dpla-51320962143%26wl5%3D9004354%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D614278180%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAu62QBhC7ARIsALXijXTmCQHAJuGEi_DuM4J080Bx9S5u2O0pnc1UkJdHYLhliSkPytZzBDAaAvpCEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> for $79.99. We don’t expect them to be widely available for much longer, however, given Jabra plans to phase out the Elite 75t in favor of more recent models, specifically the Elite 7 Pro, Elite 7 Active, and Elite 3.</p><div id=\"xQvl2n\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10386608\"></div></div><h2 id=\"pCGRtN\">Jabra Elite 75t Active deals</h2><p id=\"n2fv1m\">The Jabra Elite 75t offers a decent amount of resistance to sweat and water, but if you’re looking for a more fitness-oriented set of earbuds, we recommend taking a look at the Jabra Elite Active 75t. These earbuds are largely identical to the Elite 75t but include a rubberized coating to keep them from flying out of your ears and enhanced sweat resistance, allowing you to work out without fear of compromising your new set of earbuds. Typically $179.99, the Elite 75t are available at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cguLHpr0AZZ\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJabra-Elite-Active-75t-Copper-Black-True-Wireless-Earbuds-Copper-Black%2F722868776\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> right now for $99.99. </p><div id=\"SN8y69\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10996055\"></div></div><h2 id=\"Z2jx07\">Jabra Elite 85t deals</h2><p id=\"czo1ui\">In 2020, Jabra released the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elite 85t wireless earbuds</a>, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s current lineup. They offer more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t. However, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. That said, you can currently buy the $229.99 Jabra Elite 85t at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgDF4pEmRer\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $149.99, just $10 shy of their best price to date.</p><div id=\"3XXuQF\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10355180\"></div></div><h2 id=\"1vZaou\">Jabra Elite 3 deals</h2><p id=\"Ld5TST\">The Jabra Elite 3, one of the newer models from Jabra, are also available right now at a sizeable discount.

Normally $79.99, the earbuds are currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Built/dp/B09B45T59G/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cfVt4AzUUic\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $59.99, matching their best price to date. </p><div id=\"dX0n3Z\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10844228\"></div></div><h2 id=\"DAGlFS\">Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 deals</h2><p id=\"tmaThF\">Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 are another pair of excellent noise-canceling earbuds that are currently on sale, at least on Amazon. As noted in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">review</a>, the earbuds offer great ANC performance, customizable controls, and sound that can nearly match that of a premium pair of noise-canceling over-ear headphones. Normally $299.95, you can buy them right now at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085LVV8R7?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgDGx6eljxj\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $199.95, one of their better prices to date.</p><div id=\"yOgdox\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10882846\"></div></div><h2 id=\"TBz3wY\">Beats Powerbeats Pro deals</h2><p id=\"PJ3wLT\">If you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, it’s hard to go wrong with the predecessor to the Studio Buds, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Beats Powerbeats Pro</a>. These earbuds sport an over-ear hook that keeps them in place while you’re exercising; they also offer IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, meaning you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. </p><p id=\"aryAiB\">Currently, there are a few different discounts available on the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest price we’ve found is at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTDP6H?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, where you can buy them in select colorways for as low as $169.95.

That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen the PowerBeats Pro go for — they were on sale for around $150 throughout most of November and December — but it’s still a hefty discount on what would otherwise be a $250 pair of earbuds.</p><div id=\"0RcdxX\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10058925\"></div></div><h2 id=\"s5FT0v\">UE Fits deals</h2><p id=\"m5v8fu\">After testing a pair for ourselves, we remarked in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> that the UE Fits were the most comfortable consumer earbuds on the market. That’s because, unlike the other wireless earbuds on this list, the UE Fits are uniquely capable of permanently molding to the shape of your ears in just 60 seconds, making them a great choice for those concerned their earbuds may come loose or fall out. At the same time, however, we also found that they offer good sound quality, as well as lengthy, eight-hour battery life.</p><p id=\"fLEayc\">Normally $199.99, you can get them right now for just <a href=\"https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/c/482924/500013/8590?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcustom.ultimateears.com%2Fproducts%2Fue-fits%3Firclickid%3DwiuzeN2aXxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkG2ya3h1ykOzY0%26utm_source%3Dradius%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26irgwc%3D1&amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$169</a> — their typical sale price —from Ultimate Ears.</p><div id=\"3gZxqS\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10881349\"></div></div><aside id=\"de2M6w\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
