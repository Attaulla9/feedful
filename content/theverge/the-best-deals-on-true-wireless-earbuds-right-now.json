That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen the PowerBeats Pro go for — they were on sale for around $150 throughout most of November and December — but it’s still a hefty discount on what would otherwise be a $250 pair of earbuds.</p><div id=\"0RcdxX\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10058925\"></div></div><h2 id=\"s5FT0v\">UE Fits deals</h2><p id=\"m5v8fu\">After testing a pair for ourselves, we remarked in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> that the UE Fits were the most comfortable consumer earbuds on the market. That’s because, unlike the other wireless earbuds on this list, the UE Fits are uniquely capable of permanently molding to the shape of your ears in just 60 seconds, making them a great choice for those concerned their earbuds may come loose or fall out. At the same time, however, we also found that they offer good sound quality, as well as lengthy, eight-hour battery life.
