There’s just one big hole: you can’t play currently play Xbox with a mouse and keyboard because Xbox Cloud Gaming only supports gamepads (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813749/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-touch-controls-stats\">and touch</a>) for now. But according to <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> boss Jorg Neumann, that’s about to change: mouse and keyboard control is coming. </p><p id=\"iONgZx\">Neumann spilled the beans <a href=\"https://youtu.be/67JfwiC2hzk?t=507\">in a <em>Flight Simulator</em> video Q&amp;A</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/mouse-and-keyboard-support-coming-xbox-cloud-gaming\"><em>Windows Central</em></a>), where he says it will be platform-level support, meaning, theoretically, any Xbox cloud game could offer mouse and keyboard control. Here’s my transcript of the most relevant part:</p><blockquote><p id=\"tGAVAY\">This is a platform level support, so it has nothing to do with us, obviously mouse/keyboard works for our sim. So the platform team is working on this, and no I can’t give a date because it’s the platform team. I don’t know their dates, but it’s coming, and we are also talking about making touch work.</p></blockquote><p id=\"drkrmz\">While he’s not sure when it’s coming, Neumann suggests we might see it as soon as this summer: </p><blockquote><p id=\"XBDu8t\">I would say it’s in the next months, it’s not weeks, and it might be... I’m hoping it will be done by June or so, but I can’t ever tell. Everybody wants it, I want it, and so... it’s coming. </p></blockquote><p id=\"AvKyi8\">He also suggests that <em>Flight Simulator</em> might support touch and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22304762/microsoft-xcloud-app-windows-xbox-touch-controls-gyro-support\">even gyro control</a> so you can tilt to fly when you’re playing on, say, a phone. “The gyro is actually very good — you can get yourself more into the experience of flying a plane,” he says.</p><p id=\"0H7O7m\">Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment (or a timeline for the feature’s release).</p><p id=\"JnkWTu\">Me, I’m excited by the idea of playing <em>Halo Infinite</em> on the go with mouse and keyboard control like I do at my home PC and possibly via <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review\">the Steam Deck</a> as well. At review time, Xbox Cloud Gaming didn’t work at all on the Steam Deck because web browsers didn’t properly detect its gamepad, but I was able to trick Google Stadia into working since that cloud service <em>does</em> support mouse and keyboard — and the Steam Deck can easily emulate a keyboard and mouse. It’s also got a gyro, for that matter. </p><p id=\"VtzDqY\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890553/microsoft-activision-xbox-game-pass-competition-subscription\">With Microsoft’s Activision buy and focus on building out Xbox as a service</a>, it’s going to be interesting to see how much Microsoft invests in cloud gaming, particularly if it’s true <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917999/google-stadia-white-label-peloton-bungie-capcom\">that Google has deemphasized its rival</a>.</p><aside id=\"3KhQrg\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Microsoft quietly told Apple it was willing to turn big Xbox-exclusive games into iPhone apps\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas\"},{\"title\":\"Xbox Cloud Gaming is now fully powered by faster Xbox Series X hardware\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714067/xbox-cloud-gaming-custom-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade\"},{\"title\":\"Xbox Cloud Gaming launches in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701912/xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-australia-brazil-mexico-japan-launch-october\"}]}'></div></aside>",
