The workers also demanded that Amazon bring back 20-minute breaks — a “perk” introduced during COVID that the company has since replaced with 15-minute breaks, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88gb5p/amazon-warehouse-workers-stage-coordinated-strikes-demanding-dollar3-raises\">according to <em>Vice</em></a>. The actions are part of a wave of labor activism at Amazon as more employees band together to demand better working conditions, compensation, and representation.</p><p id=\"91ciD2\">The roughly 60 workers were employees at three different warehouses in New York and Maryland, working the night shifts. The walkout was organized by Amazonians United, a group that includes workers from at least nine warehouses nationwide, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88gb5p/amazon-warehouse-workers-stage-coordinated-strikes-demanding-dollar3-raises\">according to <em>Vice</em></a>. In December, AU led a multi-warehouse walkout in Chicago to demand better pay. According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AUchicagoland/status/1500919594101489667\">the Amazonians United Chicagoland Twitter account</a>, workers received a $2.20 raise the next month. </p><div id=\"OawjMv\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEW: Amazon promised workers in Chicago full-time roles with a hiring bonus, extra pay for working Thanksgiving, and paid bereavement leave.<br><br>Every promise was broken.<br><br>So these courageous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AUchicagoland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AUchicagoland</a> workers led the first-ever walkouts coordinated across multiple warehouses. <a href=\"https://t.co/NsMMK0NFn3\">pic.twitter.com/NsMMK0NFn3</a></p>— More Perfect Union (@MorePerfectUS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1481005332449140743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 11, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"89YTFz\">According to <em>Vice</em> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamieson/status/1504071631156744198\">a reporter from the <em>Huffington Post</em></a>, the workers striking this morning in DC make under $17 an hour and work in “megacycle” shifts — 10 hours of work done between 1AM and noon (with two 15-minute breaks and one 30-minute lunch break, according to <a href=\"https://warehouse.ninja/shifts-at-amazon-facilities/#ftoc-heading-2\">a site that compiles data about warehouse shifts</a>). </p><p id=\"5OryTh\">The raise Amazonians United is fighting for wouldn’t be unprecedented at Amazon. In April 2021, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408440/amazon-hourly-wage-increase-2021-factory-delivery-workers\">the company announced</a> that 500,000 workers would get a pay bump in amounts ranging from $0.50 an hour to $3. These raises came after a union drive at Amazon’s Bessemer facility and during another union campaign at Staten Island.</p><p id=\"zyIFTz\">Labor organization has been a big deal at Amazon recently. The two union campaigns in Alabama and New York are ongoing — the Bessemer election initially went in Amazon’s favor, but it’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878457/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-election-redo-february-fourth\">being redone</a> after the National Labor Relations Board <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive\">decided that the company had interfered with the process</a>. There are two separate union votes happening at the Staten Island facilities; one is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937440/amazon-jfk8-staten-island-union-election-march-25th\">scheduled to occur on March 25th</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/2/22959234/amazon-union-staten-island-ldj5-election-drive-nlrb-approval-go-ahead\">election details are currently being decided</a> for the second.</p><p id=\"3ay73B\">Workers have also protested the load Amazon places on them and the speed it expects them to work at. In 2019, Amazonians United workers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892693/amazon-protest-time-off-part-time-workers-sacramento-fired\">protested in Sacramento</a> after a worker was fired for using too much unpaid time off during the death of a family member. Workers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon\">have also said</a> that Amazon is harming them physically and mentally by increasing the rate at which they’re expected to work, measuring humans by efficiency standards set by machines.</p><aside id=\"AQwDar\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How hard will the robots make us work?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155254/automation-robots-unemployment-jobs-vs-human-google-amazon\"}]}'></div></aside>",
