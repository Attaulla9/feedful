This previous outage also affected API and sessions, with most users unable to log in, join calls, or send messages on the communications app. </p><p id=\"C3gsfK\">Discord also experienced a brief outage in November, after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785599/google-cloud-outage-spotify-discord-snapchat-google-cloud\">Google Cloud problems</a> caused issues for the app. Last year’s Google Cloud outage also took out Spotify, Snapchat, and Etsy.</p><p id=\"5xk4qg\"><em><strong>Update, February 15th 3PM ET</strong></em><em>: Discord is back online after a brief outage.</em></p>",
