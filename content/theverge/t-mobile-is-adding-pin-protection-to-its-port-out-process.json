These PINs will be put in place soon.”</p><p id=\"CVAt6C\">According to <em>The T-Mo Report</em>, the process will only be available to postpaid customers to start, not including people signed up through the Lifeline program. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"RnYuvh\"><q>PIN protection acts as an extra layer of security</q></aside></div><p id=\"oWpmWS\">It’s good to hear that T-Mobile may be adding this feature, as it could help prevent SIM-swapping attacks, where a scammer convinces a telecommunications provider to transfer a phone number into their control. <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/t-mobiles-finally-taking-sim-swap-fraud-seriously-with-new-transfer-pins/\">As <em>Android Police</em> notes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/port-out-faqs/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1447526/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T</a> have already implemented number transfer PINs. While it might not prevent all SIM-swapping attacks (in theory, an attacker with a T-Mobile account and device wouldn’t have to go through the port-out process since the number would be staying in the same network), the PIN requirement can act as another line of defense in addition to T-Mobile’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Faccount-takeover-protection&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F17%2F22983428%2Ft-mobile-number-transfer-pin-port-number-sim-swap-protection\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">existing account takeover protection tools</a>. </p><p id=\"uHsKjB\">SIM swap, or porting-out, attacks have seemingly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736474/sim-swapping-crypto-currency-wireless-thief-guilty\">become</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675709/sim-swapping-crypto-theft-iphone-8\">popular with</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/3/18209286/sim-hijacking-theft-california-man-jail-time-plea-deal-cryptocurrency\">cybercriminals</a> in recent years and have been implicated in high-profile cases like when <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping\">then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s Twitter account was hacked</a>. They’re attractive for a few reasons: they provide a wealth of information (many two-factor codes are still sent through SMS), and it can be difficult for a victim to realize they’ve been attacked and recover from it. The <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/port-out-fraud-targets-your-private-accounts\">Federal Communications Commission recommends</a> immediately contacting your cell carrier if you suspect someone has swapped your SIM, but that can be difficult to do given that your phone will no longer be functional.</p><aside id=\"1TdGFe\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"FCC considers new rules to stop scammers from hijacking your cell phone \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702544/fcc-rules-sim-swapping-port-out-fraud-cell-phone-carrier\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"vPK9xv\">T-Mobile’s reputation for security has taken a few hits recently, as the company has been affected by a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-data-breach-personal-information-two-million-customers\">string</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security\">data breaches</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20978498/tmobile-security-disclosed-breach-prepaid-customers\">cybersecurity incidents</a>.
