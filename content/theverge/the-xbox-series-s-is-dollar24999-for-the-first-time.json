It’s about the size of two controllers side-by-side.</em> | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</figcaption>    </figure>  <p id=\"q1EQKh\">It seems like every time we mention the Xbox Series S, it gets a little cheaper. The entry-level Xbox has slowly gone from dropping $10 to $30 off its regular $299.99 price, and now to a full $50 off. <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14323520?sid=vergedailydeals022822&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-series-s-512gb-4\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Woot has the Xbox Series S for $249.99</a> today only, or until inventory runs out. And unlike some previous Woot deals, this one’s not limited to Amazon Prime subscribers. To put it in perspective, that is half the cost of its bigger sibling, the still-elusive Xbox Series X — but to say this is half the console would not do the little white Xbox enough justice.</p><p id=\"brhKUe\">Microsoft’s cheaper Xbox Series S does not feature a disc drive, but it plays the same games as the Xbox Series X at a more modest QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution and up to 120fps in supported games. It may be a little small on storage, with a 512GB SSD that only has 364GB of usable space, but it’s also an endearingly tiny box that easily fits into any entertainment center, or even at your desk beside a gaming monitor. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><aside id=\"ed1ekr\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Twitch streaming returns to the Xbox dashboard in a new update\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947369/xbox-twitch-streaming-dashboard-update-app\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"4h1iNb\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9444105\"></div></div><p id=\"T0ja1y\">Another great deal at Woot worthy of your attention is the <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14323520?sid=vergedailydeals022822&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-4k-6\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">last-gen Apple TV 4K streaming box for just $99.99</a> for Amazon Prime subscribers. This 32GB model is available to all for $109.99 (about $69 off), but Amazon Prime users get an additional $10 discount on top of that, bringing it to about $79 off its original list price of $179. Woot has this sale for today only or until it sells out.</p><p id=\"ZffjhA\">While the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review\">newer Apple TV 4K</a> brought some welcome changes, like the much-improved Siri remote (which, by the way, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Siri-Remote-2nd-Generation/dp/B0933G71SZ/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">is compatible with the older model</a> looped into today’s deal), it does not get nearly the same price drops as the older model. The first-gen model supports 4K with Dolby Vision and HDR10, as well as the convenience of AirPlay 2. Some things you’re missing out on spec-wise by saving money and choosing the older model: faster performance with a newer processor, Wi-Fi 6, and HDMI 2.1. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"jCXABI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10617718\"></div></div><p id=\"l1yr8u\">If you want an excellent pair of earbuds but you’re on a tight budget, Best Buy has some pretty aggressive discounts on a few different certified preowned true wireless earbuds through its Geek Squad program. I know, I know — the ickiness factor of used earbuds may just be too much for you. But we’re talking about the excellent-sounding <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgI31qJBzci\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Beats Fit Pro for $129.99</a> ($70 off) in black or white (gray or purple cost an additional $10). Also, the long-lasting <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgI5ZhlBLy6\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus are $74.99</a> ($75 off), and the high-end <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgI35sHCcNu\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro are just $64.99</a> ($135 off). </p><p id=\"7MnBLH\">If you follow our deals closely, you know we don’t often mention used or refurbished earbuds, but these discounts seemed too good to not show you. Each of these refurb models has a 15-day return policy and a 90-day Geek Squad warranty, so if you have second thoughts on the cleanliness factor, you can hedge your bet a little. <strong>Read our reviews of the </strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Beats Fit Pro</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Galaxy Buds Pro</strong></a>.</p><aside id=\"2mfyTN\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"JXv8y0\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10844241\"></div></div><div id=\"C3GDY7\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10881430\"></div></div><div id=\"FHXoQ4\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10401237\"></div></div><p id=\"6BUU45\">Did you get in on the <em>Elden Ring</em> hype train last week?
