Unsurprisingly, the answer is “yes,” but with some important caveats.</p><p id=\"InbeFA\">Following up on <a href=\"https://mobilesyrup.com/2022/02/23/marvel-netflix-shows-daredevil-disney-plus-canada-march-2022/\">Mobile Syrup</a>’s initial report, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/marvel-netflix-disney-plus-release-date-canada-215441379.html?src=rss%5D\">Engadget has confirmed</a> that Netflix’s Marvel shows will begin streaming on Disney Plus in Canada on March 16th, which gels with previous reports that the series are <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/marvels-defenders-series-leaving-netflix-for-disney/\">set to leave Netflix on March 1st</a>. Between <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> and the <em>Hawkeye</em> series, fans of the Defenders have had more than a few reasons to wonder if and when <em>Daredevil</em>, <em>Jessica Jones</em>, <em>Luke Cage</em>, and the others might make the jump over to Disney’s own streaming service, but it’s unclear whether their presence on Canadian Disney Plus is a sign of story developments to come.</p><p id=\"mP1HJN\">It’s also unclear whether Disney intends to handle the former-Netflix shows the same way in all of the territories where Disney Plus is currently available, especially given that the studio does still have something of a Marvel foothold on Hulu where shows like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301774/hulu-modok-marvel-tv-show-trailer-robot-chicken\"><em>MODOK</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/19/21524039/helstrom-review-hulu-marvel-cinematic-universe-tv-series-daimon-ana-helstrom\"><em>Helstrom</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21020499/runaways-season-3-review-hulu-marvel-alex-wilder-nico-minoru-witch\"><em>Runaways</em></a> have lived in the past. Canada’s Disney Plus also being home to its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22291848/disney-plus-star-launch-europe-canada-international-streaming-hulu-breakdown\">Star content hub</a> where plenty of other mature programming can currently be accessed may be be a factor in this latest development and another sign that things may play out differently in other countries.</p>",
