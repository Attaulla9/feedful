(The company is a <a href=\"https://nianticlabs.com/blog/real-world-metaverse/\">big fan</a> of the term “real-world metaverse.”) Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, and when asked, Niantic spokesperson Jen Stratton said the details were confidential.</p><p id=\"FD7KQZ\">Niantic, the developer of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics\">hugely popular <em>Pokémon Go</em></a>, has continued to push into AR, most recently with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746427/pikmin-bloom-niantic-nintendo-pokemon-go-release-trailer\">a <em>Pikmin</em>-themed app</a>. But the company has had some misses, having shut down both <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680166/niantic-catan-world-explorers-shutdown-early-access\"><em>Catan: Settlers</em></a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759677/harry-potter-wizards-unite-shutting-down-january-2022-niantic-ar\"><em>Harry Potter</em>-themed AR game</a>. But given the acquisition announced Thursday, it seems that Niantic still believes in the potential for augmented reality apps and is aiming to make it easier for developers to make them.</p>",
