Could it be running an app store?”</p><p id=\"I9BpzT\">He also downplays the importance of hardware when it comes to Peloton’s fitness equipment. McCarthy suggests the most valuable experiences come from on-screen interaction with instructors, music, and <a href=\"https://blog.onepeloton.com/peloton-community-features/\">community features</a> (which include things like leaderboards and video chatting) that he says the fitness company has “only just begun to develop.”</p><p id=\"I19MSh\">Shaking things up some more, McCarthy <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/14/22932948/peloton-mccarthy-new-ceo-sale-connected-fitness\">once again hints at the possibility</a> of a brand new subscription model. He tells the <em>NYT</em> he wants to find the “sweet spot” between the cost of the workout equipment and a subscription to Peloton’s classes. Instead of selling Peloton’s equipment for upwards of $1,000, McCarthy envisions a “dramatically lower” upfront cost and a higher subscription fee of “maybe $70 or $80.” Peloton currently offers its subscription for $39 / month.</p><p id=\"xE1fgI\">The Peloton saga has been nothing but eventful. After its sales skyrocketed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Peloton overcompensated by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020\">spending hundreds of millions to expedite shipping</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451515/peloton-400-million-factory-ohio-treadmill-bikes\">build a new factory</a>. But as people started returning to gyms, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund\">Peloton recalled its treadmills</a> due to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389301/cpsc-treadmill-peloton-children-risk-injury\">reports of injured children and one death</a>, sales began to slump so much so that the company put a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893462/peloton-bikes-treadmills-production-connected-fitness\">pause on treadmill and bike production</a>.</p><p id=\"tcv4s7\">Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923229/peloton-layoff-new-ceo-mccarthy\">former CEO John Foley stepped down</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923480/peloton-severance-package-membership-layoffs\">announced the termination of 2,800 employees</a>. McCarthy’s first day on the job was marked by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22926095/peloton-ceo-all-hands-fired-employees\">a tense meeting with fired Peloton employees</a>, all while <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22918596/peloton-amazon-acquisition-rumor-fitness-bike-wearables\">rumors swirled about a Peloton buyout</a> (which McCarthy has since dispelled). </p><p id=\"LvSdqu\">It seems McCarthy is confident he can steer Peloton in the right direction, but he likely can’t do it by modifying subscriptions alone. Throwing an app store in the mix makes things a bit more interesting, though. It could widen Peloton’s scope beyond fitness classes and equipment, letting it leverage third-party app sales and popularity to its advantage.</p><aside id=\"s7ayC4\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"What on Earth is going on with Peloton?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923434/peloton-foley-ceo-layoffs-earnings-connected-fitness\"},{\"title\":\"Peloton’s Lanebreak video game is finally here\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/17/22939177/peloton-lanebreak-video-game-fitness-bikes\"},{\"title\":\"Peloton takes on strength training with its $495 Guide camera system, coming in 2022 \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771827/peloton-guide-camera-movement-tracking-price-release-date\"}]}'></div></aside>",
