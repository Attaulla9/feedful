The movie’s latest trailer does, though.</p><div id=\"DV8Xtv\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWzlQ2N6qqg?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"6C7dEl\">Somewhere out there in the multiverse, one of the countless variants of Stephen Strange has gone and put a dent in the multiverse that the original live-action variant now has to put right. </p><p id=\"IAsNvL\">Strange’s recent magical meddling in <em>No Way Home </em>probably has something to do with how the multiverse is damaged and how a seemingly evil variant of Strange ends up escaping from his home universe. But the new trailer also makes it seem like <em>Multiverse of Madness </em>might be the culmination of <em>all </em>the big-picture troubles that were first teased out across shows like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22233625/wandavision-marvel-avengers-mcu-disney-plus-episode-review\"><em>WandaVision</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577248/loki-season-1-review-disney-plus\"><em>Loki</em></a>, both of which strongly suggested their respective main characters <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/crazy-ex-girlfriend-foretold-wandavisions-plot-in-song-1846827349\">could have been Marvel’s next big bad</a>. To be fair, that may still turn out to be the case, as there’s likely more to <em>Multiverse of Madness</em>’ story than the trailer’s letting on.</p><p id=\"O1m7q1\"><em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </em>hits theaters on May 6th.</p>",
