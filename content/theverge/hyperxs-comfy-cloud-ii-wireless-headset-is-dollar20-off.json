It’s because other models offer a bit more in terms of functionality at a lower cost. This one doesn’t have a game / chat audio dial, nor does it include the ability to connect over Bluetooth in addition to its 2.4GHz wireless mode. Still, if you want a comfortable, long-lasting headset, this is one to check out. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"qaMSic\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9568047\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2pbFw_Hn_lTeotPrWYxNyJuPmcU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16322318/cwelch_190605_3471_0001.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite>  </figure><p id=\"cn4hpS\">We recently covered some deals happening on Bose headphones, but Woot has one of the lowest prices we’ve seen yet on a new set of the NCH 700 over-ear headphones. Normally $379, <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup030722/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/bose-active-noise-cancelling-headphones-700z-1?\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Amazon-owned online retailer is selling them for $269.99 in the silver colorway</a>. </p><p id=\"RB1dLF\">If you’re a little confused about Bose’s current lineup of noise-canceling headphones, the NCH 700 stand above the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review\">newer QC45 model</a> (which are currently $279.99) with their ability to have a custom equalizer and adjustable noise cancellation. With those traits in the NCH 700, it’s easier to make a sound profile that suits your taste. However, these can’t fold up like the QC45s, and they aren’t as lightweight. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"wMa6NZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10623742\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Actors Hidetoshi Nishijima&amp;nbsp;and Tôko Miura with the titular car\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XeQcILjq2QJGd0yrl0pEgXYn48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23241234/Screen_Shot_2022_02_14_at_2.01.22_PM.png\">      <cite>Cannes Film Festival</cite>  </figure><p id=\"lSpgYv\">If you want to catch up on 2021’s Oscar-nominated films, like <em>Drive My Car</em>, <em>Belfast</em>, <em>West Side Story</em>, and more, the easiest way to watch some of them may be to rent or buy them on Vudu. <a href=\"https://vudu.wgiftcard.com/responsive/personalize_responsive/chooseDesign/vudu/1\">And with this 15 percent off deal</a>, you can get a great discount off any Vudu gift card valued at $50 and over (via <a href=\"https://slickdeals.net/f/15647173-vudu-15-off-gift-card-orders-50?prop=rcmid-ccce021549ba498c553428e28c807f06&amp;src=foryou_recombee\"><em>Slickdeals</em></a>).

Discounts on video games are, perhaps, the best part of the celebration, and you don’t need to wait three more days to get price cuts. There are some happening now.</p><p id=\"csaCzc\"><em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</em> is $39.99 for the physical or digital version. This matches the best deal that we’ve seen yet. While <em>3D World</em> first released on the Wii U, the <em>Bowser’s Fury</em> addition is an open-world game mode that’s exclusive to the Switch. And according to Andrew Webster’s review, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22274990/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-nintendo-switch\">it’s really fun</a>.</p><div id=\"cVHWGp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10468219\"></div></div><p id=\"GLIf6i\">It’s tough to imagine there are still people out there who don’t have <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> for the Switch, but that game is also $20 off at a couple of retailers. It’s a fantastic racing game that’s fun by yourself but significantly more fun online, or at least with some competitive couch-side companions. And while it’s one of the Switch’s older games, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22926173/mario-kart-8-deluxe-is-48-remastered-courses-over-the-next-two-years-as-paid-dlc\">Nintendo shocked us last month</a> by announcing that 48 remastered courses are coming to the game as a paid add-on.</p><div id=\"VjFE2z\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11082030\"></div></div><h2 id=\"lrMPaG\">A few other stellar price cuts</h2><ul><li id=\"gXuWO3\">Keychron’s five-year birthday sale is coming to an end later today, <a href=\"https://www.keychron.com/\">giving you a few more hours to score 20 percent off nearly everything it sells</a>. There are <em>some </em>exclusions, like the Q1 Knob and its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22877979/keychron-q2-review\">Q2 keyboards</a>, and you can only get 10 percent off its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22662686/keychron-q1-review-price-mechanical-keyboard-features\">Q1 keyboard</a> that lacks a knob (my colleague Jon Porter called this one a “very easy mechanical keyboard to recommend”). Nevertheless, there’s plenty to choose from, whether you want switches, keycaps, keyboards, or other accessories. </li><li id=\"2Rjpgk\">Sony’s WH-1000XM4 over-ear wireless headphones rival the Bose NCH 700 listed at the top of this post, and you can get them at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863TXGM3?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon for $278</a> (normally $349.99). They offer incredible sound quality and comfort, and they improve on their predecessor, the XM3, with multi-point Bluetooth connections and an auto-play / pause feature when you remove them from your head. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></li><li id=\"pxkezN\">If you’re planning to build a very powerful PC (or are updating your current rig), <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-RM850x-Certified-Modular-Supply/dp/B079H5WNXN?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Corsair’s fully modular 850-watt 80 Plus Gold desktop power supply is down to $114.99</a> at Amazon. According to the CamelCamelCamel price tracker, this is the best deal since mid-January 2022.</li></ul><aside id=\"cFVGAG\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
