The Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini Hyperspeed is usually available for $179.99, but it can currently be found at both <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Mechanical/dp/B0935JBWTN?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=vergenewsletter-20&amp;linkId=a8f2e1689c79f5609d5ae4e51813089e&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&amp;utm_term=Verge%20Deals\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgGW5jaHgkJ?u1=vergenewsletter022322&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&amp;utm_term=Verge%20Deals\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for just $119.99. This discount currently matches the lowest price we’ve ever seen for this keyboard. </p><p id=\"1JqzaY\">The BlackWidow V3 Mini nixes the function row, number pad, and a few of the less popular keys for a board that takes up a bare minimum of space while retaining as much functionality as possible. The keyboard can pair with devices via Bluetooth or wireless 2.4GHz and can last for up to 200 hours on a single charge. It also uses a detachable USB-C connection that allows you to top the battery off quickly and uses custom cable mods too. </p><p id=\"PCWenr\">While it doesn’t use Razer’s optical switches, the BlackWidow V3 Mini can be equipped with your choice of Razer’s proprietary linear yellow or clicky green switches.</p><div id=\"q6fOXL\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11065346\"></div></div><p id=\"KZco47\">A pair of webcams from Logitech is currently on sale. Right now, you can find the Logitech 4K Pro webcam at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1650419-REG%2Flogitech_960_001390_4k_hd_webcam.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F25%2F22949049%2Frazer-blackwidow-v3-mini-hyperspeed-keyboard-logitech-4k-pro-webcam-blue-microphone-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H photo for $159.99</a>, a decent value for a camera that typically sells for $199.99. Based on our research, it's tough to find a 4K webcam for less than $200, making this sale certainly worthy of consideration. </p><p id=\"BJ9Jsx\">As the name suggests, the 4K Pro webcam is capable of recording 4K footage at up to 30 frames per second — more specifically, at a resolution of 4096 x 2160p. It's also capable of recording at 1080p and 720p up to speeds of 60fps and 90fps, respectively. This high-resolution capture capability also allows you to log in to your computer using Windows Hello facial recognition. The lens has an adjustable field of view, and the camera is also equipped with a pair of built-in mics for audio capture.</p><p id=\"5R77QR\">Of course, if you’re planning on doing any type of streaming on a regular basis, you’ll be better served by a dedicated microphone. Thankfully, Best Buy is offering a bundle that combines the Logitech C922 Pro HD webcam with the Blue Yeti USB microphone. Purchased separately, this bundle would cost you $229.99, but it’s <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgHNQke38oX\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently discounted to $149.99 at Best Buy</a>.</p><p id=\"Oawzml\">While the camera only features a maximum capture resolution of 1080p at 30fps, this is more than enough for streaming and other scenarios that demand a dedicated webcam. Some of the features that make this standalone camera a better choice are the larger field of view and the autofocus function. A dedicated webcam also offers greater control over your image — in this case, by way of Logitech’s Capture software, which allows you to fine-tune brightness, contrast, and other settings.</p><p id=\"8uRa2G\">Meanwhile, the Blue Yeti standalone mic offers a drastic improvement in terms of audio quality. The robust condenser microphone offers a variety of pickup patterns and can be mounted to a boom if you need to free up some space on your desk.</p><div id=\"lLwQBk\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11065880\"></div></div><div id=\"cggWhj\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11066989\"></div></div><aside id=\"nVgFrE\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Twitch creates new program to pay streamers more reliably\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947490/twitch-ad-incentive-program-guranteed-monthly-payments\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"KcMfUk\">One final note before class is dismissed for the weekend: the deadline to enter our tech bag giveaway for February is almost here, but you still have time to enter.
