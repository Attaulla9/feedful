Thankfully, there are excellent third-party alternatives like 8BitDo’s Pro 2, which is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B08XY8H9D5/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently on sale at Amazon for $44.99</a> instead of $49.99 when you clip the on-page coupon located below the price.</p><p id=\"gnJnNv\">We called the 8BitDo Pro 2 the best Switch controller you can buy <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons\">when we reviewed it last year</a>, one that takes a cue from the original Super Nintendo controller and offers some added functionality over Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller. 8BitDo’s Pro 2 lacks some of the features found on Nintendo’s first-party offering — including HD rumble and Amiibo support— but it includes hand grips and customizable back paddles, as well as Bluetooth for connecting the controller to your PC, Mac, or mobile device. Plus, it’s rechargeable via USB-C and comes in black or one of several retro-inspired colors. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"QHbNmY\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11056056\"></div></div><aside id=\"2IvJof\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are some must-have accessories for your new Nintendo Switch\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22912942/best-nintendo-switch-controllers-cases-chargers-headsets-accessories\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"kxkL9L\">Significant deals on Apple’s 14-inch MacBook Pro have been nearly impossible to find since the powerful laptop launched late last year, but today, you can save around $249.01 on one of the higher-end, M1 Pro-equipped configurations. Right now, the $2,499 model equipped with a 1TB SSD, a 10-core M1 Pro CPU, 16GB of RAM, and the upgraded 16-core GPU is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQWSQK7?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale at Amazon for $2,249.99</a>, a price that will be reflected in your cart at checkout.</p><p id=\"FMzNbP\">To say we were impressed by the latest MacBook Pro line is an understatement — after all, we gave the 14-inch laptop a rare 9.5/10 in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review\">review</a>. Apple’s latest machines are the fastest laptops we’ve ever tested when it comes to performing many tasks, rendering them a great pick for power users looking to do heavy creative work like video editing and other forms of content creation. They also offer a beautiful display and a more robust port selection than the previous models, not to mention some of the longest battery life we’ve seen in a laptop. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a> </p><div id=\"eFBTbb\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10814206\"></div></div><aside id=\"1juzFb\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best deals on MacBooks right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals\"},{\"title\":\"The best laptop you can buy in 2022\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"y0ADTn\">You can spend your three-day weekend saving while streaming with this discounted three-month subscription to YouTube TV. For a limited time only, new subscribers can <a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/\">pay $54.99 a month instead of $64.99 for their first three months</a>. That would typically cost you around $195 all said, so that means you’ll pay $165 by the end of this discount period. That’s a small yet welcome discount on service that has increasingly gotten more expensive over the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17109018/youtube-tv-price-change-signup-grandfathered-google\">last few years</a>. You can also cancel your subscription whenever you’d like.</p><p id=\"INB4lR\">With YouTube TV, you’ll be able to access over 85 on-demand channels covering live sports, news, entertainment, and a breadth of other content. The subscription also comes with unlimited recording and DVR capabilities for up to six accounts, as well as the ability for three simultaneous streams. It’s a solid service overall, especially given it’s compatible with most streaming devices, and it uses the YouTube interface, which you’re already probably familiar with. </p><div id=\"Z3BM7n\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10989551\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5MXoS9PYWRG6dC3Rv5svetGDnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774320/cwelch_210809_4705_0004.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Galaxy Buds 2 are Samsung’s smallest and lightest wireless earbuds.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"Y1mCpG\">If you’re an Android user looking for a reliable pair of true wireless earbuds, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 have returned to their best-ever price. Normally $149.99, <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDealsFeb182022&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_campaign%3DCJ%26cjevent%3Da64ab56e904411ec8023e4520a1c0e0e%26utm_source%3DVox%2BMedia\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Woot is currently selling them for $99.99</a> with a 90-day Woot warranty.

They’re a great pick for Android users looking for a pair of earbuds with good sound, wireless charging, and a subtle design that, for better or worse, won’t turn many heads.</p><div id=\"4qcGPp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10707231\"></div></div><p id=\"lbzkde\">Still looking for the right smart speaker for your home? Well, if you’re a Costco member, you can snag <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/homepod-mini.product.100696292.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s HomePod mini right now for $79.99</a> instead of $99. That’s one of the best deals we’ve seen on Apple’s pint-sized smart speaker, which sounds great despite its size and offers the full range of Siri voice capabilities. It also can also act as a hub for your home via HomeKit and, if you own an iPhone, can be used to make calls and send messages. Sadly, the current discount only runs through February 23rd and only applies to the white and space gray models — not any of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22761626/apple-homepod-mini-hands-on\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fun, vibrant colors Apple recently introduced late last year</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"NxlDZ4\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10883175\"></div></div><p id=\"GOE7oO\">It may be a last-gen model, but the 2018 Kindle Paperwhite is still a good e-reader with a great E Ink display. You can take the waterproof device in the bath with you and read for hours on end without worrying about battery life, as we found it can last for weeks. While its 6-inch display isn’t as big as the screen on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2021 model</a> and it still charges via Micro USB, it remains a solid option if you’re looking for an affordable alternative to the newer model. That’s because Woot is currently taking $50 off the popular e-reader, <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13142085?sid=TheVergeDailyDealsFeb182022&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fkindle-paperwhite-2018-10th-gen-7\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">selling the 8GB, ad-supported configuration for just $79.99</a>, which is about $10 shy of its lowest price to date. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"0onlgW\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9552401\"></div></div><h2 id=\"OpvIDP\">Other deals worth considering</h2><ul><li id=\"VBoZsX\">If you’re set on a 2-in-1 computer, the 2020 Microsoft Surface Book 3 is currently <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgExiKpG6Fo\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale for its lowest price to date at Best Buy</a>. The discounted model comes with an Intel 10th Gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $899.99, a healthy $700 off the list price. While still expensive for an older model and lacking in storage, we liked its keyboard and the display’s 3:2 aspect ratio, as well as its all-day battery life. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</li><li id=\"7Docz0\">If you own a Samsung Galaxy device and are on the market for a Tile-like Bluetooth tracker for keeping tabs on your belongings, Amazon is knocking a couple dollars off of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartTag-Bluetooth-Tracker-Locator/dp/B08NRSKY3F?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag in black, costing $26.99</a> instead of $30</li><li id=\"xNyXPq\">Ultimate Ears’ Boom 3 may be pretty old at this point — the rugged Bluetooth speaker came out in 2018 — but it’s still a good-sounding speaker with IP67 dust and water resistance, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/7/22/20703600/ue-boom-3-magic-play-pause-button-bluetooth-speaker\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an iconic button</a>.
