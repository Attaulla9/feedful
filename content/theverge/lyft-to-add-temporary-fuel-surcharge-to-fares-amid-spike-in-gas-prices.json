We’ll share more details shortly.” </p><p id=\"RLOAm5\">Lyft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973474/uber-temporary-fuel-surcharge-fee-ev\">follows Uber</a> in announcing a temporary fuel surcharge as gas prices have spiked in part due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Uber’s surcharge for rides adds “either $0.45 or $0.55 on each Uber trip,” depending on a rider’s location, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fblog%2Ffuel-surcharge%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F14%2F22977744%2Flyft-temporary-fuel-surcharge-fares-uber\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to Uber’s blog about the change</a>.</p><p id=\"kPYnsg\">Like Uber, Lyft says the entirety of the surcharge will go to drivers. Uber’s surcharge will apply even if a ride is done in an electric vehicle, but it’s unclear if that will apply to Lyft’s surcharge as well.</p><aside id=\"i3rhCf\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"EVs won’t save us from high gas prices\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973174/gas-prices-electric-vehicles-inventory-russia\"},{\"title\":\"Your next Uber ride will have an extra fee for gas — even if it’s in an EV\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973474/uber-temporary-fuel-surcharge-fee-ev\"}]}'></div></aside>",
