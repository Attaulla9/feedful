The feature was previously only available to Twitter Blue subscribers, but it’s now coming to everyone on Android, iOS, and the web.</p><p id=\"SXf8Np\">The feature doesn’t seem to be fully rolled out just yet. I have access to it on the iOS app, but not on Twitter’s web app. On the iOS app, you can swipe to the side on a conversation to reveal a pin, and if you tap that, the conversation will be moved to a new “Pinned conversations” section at the top of your DM inbox.</p><div id=\"Pornkg\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Keep your fave DM convos easily accessible by pinning them! You can now pin up to six conversations that will stay at the top of your DM inbox.<br><br>Available on Android, iOS, and web. <a href=\"https://t.co/kIjlzf9XLJ\">pic.twitter.com/kIjlzf9XLJ</a></p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1494386367467593737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 17, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"Bw0pvB\">Pins could be a useful way to keep a handful of conversations easily accessible, though I can see how some people might be disappointed to know that you can only keep six at the top of the list.</p><p id=\"xUur5l\">Now that pins are rolling out more widely, there are two features that currently live under Twitter Blue’s exclusive Labs label: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751003/twitter-blue-subscribers-labs-early-access-features\">longer video uploads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893502/nft-twitter-profile-picture-crypto-wallet-opensea-coinbase-right-click\">NFT profile pictures</a>. If you want to try those out now, you’ll have to subscribe to Twitter Blue, which costs $2.99 per month in the US (and varies depending on where you are based).</p>",
