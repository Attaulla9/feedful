The change, which was available first on iOS and was set to arrive “soon” on Android and the web, made it more difficult to view tweets in chronological order. Following significant pushback, Twitter announced Monday that it would be reverting things to the way they used to be.</p><p id=\"M7M7sP\">“We heard you — some of you always want to see latest Tweets first,” Twitter said in a tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1503443926258180106\">on its support account</a>. “We’ve switched the timeline back and removed the tabbed experience for now while we explore other options.”</p><div id=\"ufh6DM\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We heard you –– some of you always want to see latest Tweets first. We've switched the timeline back and removed the tabbed experience for now while we explore other options. <a href=\"https://t.co/euVcPr9ij6\">https://t.co/euVcPr9ij6</a></p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1503443926258180106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 14, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"IN4SU2\">Some users shared <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1502055265809895425\">criticism</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1502723616617730054\">of the change</a> almost immediately after its March 10th announcement, as the Latest feed is preferred to the Home feed for many. The out-of-sequence Home feed can, at times, be confusing, especially for people who use Twitter for updates during a breaking news event like the war in Ukraine. However, two <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaysullivan/status/1502727180215758849\">Twitter</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tapatinah/status/1503396917023236105\">execs</a> noted in replies to <em>Verge</em> contributing editor Casey Newton that they would be working on the problem, and it appears that the original change won’t be going through as planned.</p><div id=\"uujKyE\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The constant forced reversion to the home timeline is Twitter’s worst product decision in ages.

Stay tuned.” Sullivan added that he was hoping the platform could achieve <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaysullivan/status/1502728201507794944\">“a nice balance for all.”</a></p>",
