It is remarkably satisfying to see the yachts get seized.</p><p id=\"uuIZqt\">An expensive toy for worthless people, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2022/03/01/biden-and-allies-are-coming-for-russian-billionaires-yachts-forbes-tracked-down-36-heres-where-to-find-them/?sh=3abd14544624\">the megayacht is the epitome of conspicuous consumption</a>. For instance, the Amore Vero, linked to Rosneft CEO Igor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/24/putin-tightens-grip-on-economy\">“Darth Vader”</a> Sechin, has a <a href=\"https://www.oceancoyacht.com/fleet/amore-vero/\">swimming pool that converts to a helicopter platform</a>. This boat exists only to please Sechin and impress his guests; it has a similar relationship to regular boats as handmade silk toilet paper does to Charmin.</p><p id=\"jqIb2z\">Here is a short and delightful list of megayacht action:</p><ul><li id=\"dbFMDZ\">Sechin attempted to evade sanctions by ordering the Amore Vero to sail to Turkey. It was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-oligarch-igor-sechin-yacht-crew-sail-turkey-sanctions-report-2022-3\">seized in France</a>.</li><li id=\"KsBzAd\">Former KGB officer Sergei Chemezov, who now leads Rostec, had his 279-foot $140 million <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/spain-has-sezied-russian-oligarchs-140m-superyacht-in-barcelona-pm-says\">megayacht seized in Spain</a>. “There will be more,” promised Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez. Can’t wait, babe.</li><li id=\"JEcEct\">Not actually a seizure, but possibly funnier: former KGB agent Vladimir Strzhalkovsky has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/03/16/1086896823/vladimir-strzhalkovsky-superyacht-norway\">a yacht named Ragnar that’s stuck in Norway</a>. <a href=\"https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/editorial-features/ragnar-explorer-superyacht\">Aboard Ragnar</a> are lots of toys, such as “a BigBo amphibious ATV, heli-skiing equipment, four See-Doos, four ski scooters, six Seabobs, a multipurpose island and a giant slide.” It can’t go anywhere because no one will sell it fuel. The yacht’s captain finds this “extremely unjust,” according to <em>NPR</em>.</li><li id=\"43bTLU\"><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/03/here-are-the-russian-oligarch-yachts-being-seized-as-sanctions-take-effect.html\">The $735 million superyacht Dilbar</a>, named for Kremlin-tied oligarch Alisher Usmanov’s mother, was possibly seized in Germany, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-seizes-russian-billionaire-alisher-usmanovs-mega-yacht-forbes-2022-3\">depending on your definition of “seized.”</a> (Government officials say it’s not <em>seized</em> per se; it just can’t leave.) It has the dubious honor of sporting the largest indoor swimming pool ever installed on a private vehicle. Here is a video of Usmanov gloating about his yacht: </li></ul><div id=\"5Azcyi\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">“I just want to explain to you so that you wouldn’t be jealous.

Its owner, sanctioned fertilizer mogul Andrey Melnichenko, told CNN through a spokesman that Melnichenko has “no political affiliations.” Yes, I’m sure he got one of the largest yachts in the world by being a normal businessman. Here is a video of the seizure: </li></ul><div id=\"E77q5v\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Italy’s financial police (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GDF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GDF</a>) has just frozen “SY A” - a sailing yacht worth ~€530m located in the Port of Trieste. The yacht could be linked indirectly to Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko - an individual in the EU sanctions list. <a href=\"https://t.co/fRg6ZTIQRH\">pic.twitter.com/fRg6ZTIQRH</a></p>— Ferdinando Giugliano (@FerdiGiugliano) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FerdiGiugliano/status/1502542506763993089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><ul><li id=\"v9t7dR\">Italy has been quite busy, actually!

In addition to its pool and helicopter landing pad, the Lady M also has its own salon, so no one aboard will have to suffer the indignity of doing their own hair.</li></ul><div id=\"1IudWb\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Italy’s police has just seized “Lady M Yacht” - a €65m yacht belonging to Alexey Alexandrovits Mordaschov located in Imperia (Liguria) - in compliance with the recent EU sanctions. <a href=\"https://t.co/8NzqkXH7lE\">pic.twitter.com/8NzqkXH7lE</a></p>— Ferdinando Giugliano (@FerdiGiugliano) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FerdiGiugliano/status/1499844081467461641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 4, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"8O9nS7\"></p>",
