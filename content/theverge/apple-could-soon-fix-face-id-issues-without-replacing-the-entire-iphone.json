As a result, stores and authorized providers would perform same-unit repairs when a phone suffers from Face ID issues instead of replacing the device. </p><p id=\"bq7iuA\">As described by Apple in an internal memo provided to <em>MacRumors</em>, the move will reduce the carbon footprint of its products by decreasing the number of whole-unit repairs. If it happens, it also means owners of iPhone XS models and newer won’t need to set up a new iPhone and possibly lose data just because of a Face ID problem.</p><aside id=\"sbVzR6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple’s Face ID with a Mask works so well, it might end password purgatory\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22912677/apple-face-id-mask-update-ios-15-4-beta-hands-on-impressions\"},{\"title\":\"Apple explains how Face ID learns from its mistakes\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16373710/face-id-iphone-x-apple-facial-recognition-impostor\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"Dn8qFf\">It’s not clear yet when this new repair process will be implemented. The company has only told technicians they will receive training and documentation at a later date. </p><p id=\"FnSgzK\">The news comes a few months after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787144/apple-home-repair-iphone-mac-parts-tools-instructions\">Apple announced the new “Self Service Repair” program</a>, another move that could also make repairs easier. Through the initiative, Apple will instruct customers how to fix their devices at home while selling them the parts and tools. Customers will also receive recycling credit when they return their used parts after fixing their devices. </p><p id=\"E9AFpi\">Apple said the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/\">“Self Service Repair” program</a> would launch early this year in the US and then expand to other countries later.</p><aside id=\"pctpLa\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"iPhones will be able to give owners a detailed history of what parts were replaced\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824733/apple-iphone-part-service-history-ios-15-2\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"zdBImc\"></p><p id=\"wOer4Q\"></p><p id=\"JnAEf9\"></p>",
