People close to the situation told <em>Bloomberg</em> that YouTube is offering individual shows $50,000 and up to $300,000 for podcast networks, potentially to fund filmed episodes and other video-based content.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"8Kckio\"><q>YouTube has been making small advances towards pleasing listeners on the platform</q></aside></div><p id=\"INOVR4\">Despite being a platform for video, the Google-owned YouTube hosts a number of popular podcasts, including the <em>H3 Podcast</em>, <em>Full Send Podcast</em>, and the Logan Paul-led <em>Impaulsive</em>. It even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21264838/joe-rogan-youtube-podcast-spotify-video-future-creators\">helped foster the growth</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22912275/joe-rogan-spotify-covid-misinformation-moderation-podcast-exclusive\">controversial <em>Joe Rogan Experience</em></a>, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263927/joe-rogan-spotify-experience-exclusive-content-episodes-youtube\">Spotify purchased the exclusive rights</a> to in 2020.</p><p id=\"ElKJxO\">YouTube has been making small advances towards pleasing listeners on the platform. In October, it began allowing all <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708688/youtube-music-free-background-listening-date\">Canadian users to listen to audio</a> without having the app open — a feature previously only available to YouTube Premium subscribers. Around the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746466/youtube-podcasting-kai-chuk-amazon-project-mic-live-audio-hot-pod\">YouTube also hired Kai Chuk</a> to lead the company’s podcasting efforts. Although Spotify <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332584/spotify-video-podcasts-feature-upload\">already supports video podcasts</a>, getting popular shows to make accompanying videos that are perhaps exclusive to the platform could help build an audience that wants more than just audio.</p><p id=\"3Jic2J\"><em>The Verge</em> reached out to Google with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.</p>",
