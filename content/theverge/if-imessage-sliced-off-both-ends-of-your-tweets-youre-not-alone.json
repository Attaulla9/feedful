If you were on an Apple device and texting a tweet to your buddy on an Apple device, the first and last characters in the tweet wouldn’t show up. As <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/18/latest-random-twitter-bug-causes-text-to-disappear-in-imessage-previews/\">reported by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>, tweet previews sent via iMessage seemed to be missing the first and last characters of the tweet, making them read oddly.</p><p id=\"Edl8jp\">Myself and another <em>Verge</em> writer experienced this bug as well. Here’s how Apple’s Messages app on my iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch displayed a tweet I wrote yesterday:</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJ1cgemBt5VTWyhIY9DAjOLEZbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23256381/Screen_Shot_2022_02_18_at_3.03.16_PM.png\">      <cite>Screenshots by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Can you guess what letters are missing?</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"Au7W4y\">And here’s what the tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1494367321653010448\">I made yesterday</a> actually looked like:</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cKUdSR-TZOdheyFBIpg3GiXirfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23256366/Screen_Shot_2022_02_18_at_2.54.59_PM.png\">      <cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>(They didn’t.)</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"QxC10a\">When reached for comment, Twitter spokesperson Stephanie Cortez originally said the bug seemed to have been fixed, but it turns out that wasn’t the case — Cortez said shortly after we first published this article that the company was aware of the issue and looking into a fix. When I checked late Friday evening, the bug was fixed for me on all of my devices. Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment.</p><p id=\"wqyj1t\"><em><strong>Update February 18th, 10:15PM ET</strong></em><em>: The bug is fixed for me on my devices.</em></p>",
