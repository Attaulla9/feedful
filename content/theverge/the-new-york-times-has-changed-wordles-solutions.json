But here’s a big change the <em>NYT</em> isn’t shouting about: it’s altered Wordle’s solutions. As of today, February 15th (game number 241), the <em>New York Times</em> version of Wordle and the original version hosted at <a href=\"http://powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle\">powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle</a> have diverged and will now continue forever out of step. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"hP6AwV\"><q>The New York Times told publications “nothing has changed”</q></aside></div><p id=\"0ON5kL\">Changes to Wordle’s word list by the <em>NYT</em> were spotted last week by a number of sources, <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2022/02/11/pussy-pupal-and-agora-among-words-removed-from-wordle-after-move-to-new-york-times.html\">including <em>BoingBoing</em></a>. Although some thought these changes only applied to the words you could <em>guess</em>, it turns out the <em>Times</em> also altered the list of possible <em>solutions</em>. (<em>The Verge </em>made this mistake as well — we regret the error.) This confusion wasn’t helped by the fact that the <em>Times </em>itself was running round telling publications that everything was the same in Wordle land. As <em>NYT</em> comms director Jordan Cohen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/14/is-wordle-getting-harder-viral-game-tests-players-after-new-york-times-takeover\">told <em>The Guardian</em></a>: “Nothing has changed about the game play.” Which is really not true!</p><p id=\"vKQShW\">Sure, the game plays the same, but the <em>Times</em> has not only removed rude words like “pussy” and “whore” from possible guesses, it’s also changed the game’s future solutions. And surely for a game all about guessing words this counts as a change to gameplay.</p><p id=\"Wxwhyw\"><em><strong>Warning: spoilers for the non-NYT version of Wordle</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>follow</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p id=\"M6v0AH\">As <em>BoingBoing </em>notes, words that have been removed from guesses and solutions include “fibre,” “pupal,” “slave,” and “wench.” You can find a list of the original Wordle solutions <a href=\"https://medium.com/@owenyin/here-lies-wordle-2021-2027-full-answer-list-52017ee99e86\">here</a> and can check that against <em>NYT</em>’s altered list by <a href=\"https://uk.pcmag.com/games/138290/want-to-up-your-wordle-game-the-winning-word-is-right-on-the-page\">following these instructions here</a>. A warning: clicking these links will spoil future solutions for you if you scroll too far ahead, so I’ll save you the danger and just say that the <em>Times</em> has skipped today’s original solution (#241) of “agora” and moved to the next day’s (#242), which is [cough-cough-mumble-mumble]. </p><p id=\"2Ad91G\">Does all this matter? Well, yes, a little! Because if you’re still playing the original version of Wordle — either because you <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22912711/wordle-web-save-download-webpage-local-personal\">downloaded the game</a> or you haven’t refreshed your browser since loading the original <a href=\"http://powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle\">powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle</a> URL — then you will be out of step with other players. And given so much of the game’s pleasure is social, based on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22881995/wordle-emoji-results-auto-generated-tell-a-story\">sharing those little emoji solutions</a>, this can be frustrating, as demonstrated by the tweets below:</p><div id=\"71GeSL\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Alert!  Wordle discrepancy  I've still been playing at the powerlanguage site, because I didn't know there was a new NYT URL, and today the solution was different (for the first time).
