The letter cites the negative environmental effects of NFTs as well as their status as “unregulated, highly speculative financial assets.”</p><p id=\"PCRS8q\"><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/09/salesforce-tells-employees-its-working-on-nft-cloud-service.html\"><em>CNBC</em> reported last week</a> that Salesforce plans to launch an “NFT cloud” sales platform that could let users create and release token-based content, potentially even competing with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914081/open-sea-nft-marketplace-web3-fundraising-finzer-a16z\">dominant OpenSea NFT marketplace</a>. Salesforce market strategy director Mathew Sweezey wrote in December that “you’re going to hear a lot more about NFTs” in 2022, although he was speaking generally about the tech world, and the company hasn’t unveiled concrete plans.</p><p id=\"HCHBT9\">The <em>Thomson Reuters</em> report notes that not all employees at Salesforce oppose the NFT plan. But its opponents voiced harsh criticism of the move; at least one told the outlet he would quit if Salesforce launched the product.</p><p id=\"3Inhon\">“Our core values guide everything we do, including the development of our products,” said Salesforce spokesperson Karly Bolton in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “We welcome our employees’ feedback and are proud to foster a culture of trust that empowers them to raise diverse points of view. We are hosting a listening session with employees next week and will use their input to strengthen our path forward.”</p><p id=\"A4YgLt\">Crypto platforms have launched a massive recent publicity push, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/14/22933456/crypto-super-bowl-commercials-impact-advertisements-analysis-fomo\">during the Super Bowl</a> last week. But NFTs and cryptocurrency have polarized large sections of the tech industry, and some companies have pulled back on their plans after internal and external backlash. Game companies <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913110/team17-worms-nft-metaworms-gaming-playtonic-overcooked\">Team17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled\">GSC Game World</a> canceled NFT projects altogether, and crowdfunding platform Kickstarter announced yesterday that it would <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/22938852/kickstarter-blockchain-delay-white-paper-advisory-council\">slow its transition</a> to a blockchain protocol. </p><p id=\"OKpqaO\"><em><strong>Update 3:55PM ET: </strong></em><em>Added statement from Salesforce.</em></p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"HD6kXh\"><h2 id=\"eTpeW8\">Related:</h2><div id=\"INL6iA\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"The $13B casino of NFTs|104335\" data-volume-uuid=\"d82d68ac5\" data-volume-id=\"104335\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-294\" class=\"volume-video\"></div></div>",
