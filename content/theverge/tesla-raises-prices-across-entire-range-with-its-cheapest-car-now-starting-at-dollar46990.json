Prices have increased by between 5 to 10 percent, with the cheapest car the company sells — the Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive — now starting at $46,990, while its top-end Model X Tri motor saw a price increase of $12,500, from $126,490 to $138,990. </p><p id=\"m0bU7d\">It’s the second price bump Tesla has implemented in less than a week, after it increased the cost of certain long-range models <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2022/03/09/tesla-increases-prices-long-range-versions-of-model-3-y-nickel-prices-surge/\">last Wednesday</a>. However, today’s price raises are not only more substantial than last week’s but apply to every vehicle the company sells.</p><p id=\"nITTh6\">Here’s how those increases play out (with old prices sourced from archived copies of Tesla’s website via Wayback Machine, dated to March 10th or more recent):</p><ul><li id=\"HmSibd\"><strong>Model 3</strong> <strong>Rear-Wheel Drive:</strong> $44,990 to $46,990</li><li id=\"ryddiO\"><strong>Model 3</strong> <strong>Long Range: </strong>$51,990 to $54,490</li><li id=\"WIGFHT\"><strong>Model 3 Performance: </strong>$58,990 to $61,990</li><li id=\"qeXBVA\"><strong>Model Y Long Range: </strong>$59,990 to $62,990</li><li id=\"e1Ovra\"><strong>Model Y Performance: </strong>$64,990 to $67,990</li><li id=\"zftjtD\"><strong>Model S Dual Motor: </strong>$94,990 to $99,990</li><li id=\"gJTeNj\"><strong>Model S Tri Motor: </strong>$129,990 to $135,990</li><li id=\"VpmrCO\"><strong>Model X Dual Motor: </strong>$104,990 to $114,990</li><li id=\"o8c9oP\"><strong>Model X Tri Motor: </strong>$126,490 to $138,990</li></ul><p id=\"NcYyUf\">Tesla and its otherwise-garrulous CEO Elon Musk have yet to comment specifically on the new price increases, but a number of factors have likely played a part. On Monday, Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1503184467397128194\">tweeted</a> that “Tesla &amp; SpaceX are seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials &amp; logistics” — inflation is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60696125\">up 7.9 percent in the US this year</a>, caused by the increasing cost of energy, food, and services, while the prices of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967402/electric-vehicle-prices-nickel-trading-ukraine-russia\">raw materials</a> used to build EVs (like steel, nickel, and palladium) are soaring in price due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>",
