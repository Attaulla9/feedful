Developer Polyphony Digital hasn’t detailed what the underlying issue might be, and Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"M5mQn4\"><q>Update 1.07 adjusted rewards for some races</q></aside></div><p id=\"oN2v3d\">According to <a href=\"https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/gt7/news/00_1764433.html\">Polyphony’s patch notes</a>, Update 1.07 adds a number of fixes and changes, including a new <a href=\"https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/gt7/news/00_5186203.html\">broadcast mode</a> that removes all licensed music tracks. However, Polyphony says it also adjusted the rewards for some events, and players <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/tg5hzl/update_details_107_rally_licensesmissionscircuit/\">appear to have found</a> that for many races, you now get fewer credits, making it more difficult to save up in-game currency for more expensive cars. </p><p id=\"7B3ZqN\">Scanning through the <em>Gran Turismo</em> subreddit, it’s clear that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/comments/tggvx0/update_complaints_mega_thread_17322/\">many fans are particularly unhappy</a> with the credits changes in the patch. Sony does sell in-game credits for real-world dollars that could help you get the cars you want, but those microtransactions are on top of the $60 or $70 you’re already paying just to buy the game (depending on if you get it for PS4 or PS5). It’s unclear if Polyphony will be making changes to the credit payouts in response to fan outcry.</p>",
