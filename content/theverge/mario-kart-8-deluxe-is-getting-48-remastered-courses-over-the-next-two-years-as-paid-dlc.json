Ultimate</em> DLC characters, the reprised Mario Kart 8 Deluxe courses will be added in six waves of eight courses each released over the next two years. Given that <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> current has 48 courses, the expansion pass will double the number of courses available to players once it finishes up in 2023. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fz7hcbVc5SmMDpVZc2n6HZhwu0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23230663/Screen_Shot_2022_02_09_at_5.42.02_PM.png\">  </figure><p id=\"orBvwG\">The first wave of courses is set to arrive on March 18th, and will include Coconut Mall from <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>, Choco Mountain from <em>Mario Kart 64</em>, and Tokyo Blur from <em>Mario Kart Tour</em>. The full Booster Course DLC pack will cost $24.99 for all 48 courses, but Nintendo is also including the DLC for free for subscribers to its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing\">premium Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> tier, which costs $49.99 per year for an individual subscription. </p><p id=\"SA9006\">While fans may have been hoping for a new Mario Kart game (<em>Mario Kart 8 </em>was originally released for the Wii U back in 2014), it makes sense that Nintendo would be looking to continue sticking with the current Switch version of the game, which holds the title as both the top-selling Switch game and the <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-04-mario-kart-8-deluxe-is-now-the-series-best-selling-entry\">most sold Mario Kart game in the series’ history</a>. </p>",
