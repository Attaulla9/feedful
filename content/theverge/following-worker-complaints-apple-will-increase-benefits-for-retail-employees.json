The days can be used for mental health leave and taking family members to the doctor. This change will give full-time workers 12 paid sick days, instead of six.</p><p id=\"5P1lIx\">Workers will receive more annual vacation days, beginning at three years of employment instead of five.</p><p id=\"1N7vIy\">Part-time employees will now get as many as six paid vacation days for the first time. Another first: They’ll get paid parental leave. That benefit will cover up to six weeks and will include the ability to gradually ramp up work time for the first four weeks back.</p><p id=\"Uzeb6c\">Part-time workers also will get access to discounted emergency backup care for children or elderly family members.</p></blockquote><p id=\"g3Gpw1\">Apple confirmed the changes to <em>Bloomberg</em> and noted that they had been in the works for several months.</p><p id=\"33z5Rb\">The new benefits arrive following <em>The Verge’s</em> extensive December report about how Apple’s frontline workers, including those on its retail, support, and sales teams, are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic\">struggling to survive</a> and that their complaints about working conditions have been largely ignored. Apple’s retail employees have also had to struggle with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838172/apple-stores-close-retail-covid-19-cases-infections\">store closures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid\">shifting policies about mask-wearing</a> due to COVID-19. In January, the company announced internally that both corporate and retail staffers would <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/15/22885181/apple-vaccine-covid-19-booster-shot-employees\">have to get a COVID-19 booster shot</a> or show a negative COVID-19 test before entering the workplace. </p>",
