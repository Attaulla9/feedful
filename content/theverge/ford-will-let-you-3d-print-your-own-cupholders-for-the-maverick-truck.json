This week, Ford <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/support/how-tos/owner-resources/vehicle-documents/how-do-i-use-3d-printing-to-customize-my-ford-maverick-pickup/\">released CAD files</a> of the Maverick’s storage area under the rear seats and also for its slotted accessories called the Ford Integrated Tether System (FITS).</p><p id=\"eVOX6d\">There are a total of eight FITS slots in the vehicle: one behind the center console where a cupholder would normally go in many vehicles and seven under the rear seat bench. It’s designed to be modular, allowing customers to order a set of accessories to fit different needs, like storage dividers to separate cleats and footballs or grocery bag hooks.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AhkzdEOpq8wMlgHwKrstjSX15fk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23249309/Screen_Shot_2022_02_15_at_4.49.52_PM.png\">      <cite>Image: Ford</cite>      <figcaption><em>Ford’s $50 3D-printed FITS accessory pack, available when building a new 2022 Ford Maverick truck.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"v6LX78\">The company <a href=\"https://accessories.ford.com/products/maverick-2022-ford-integrated-tether-system-fits-package\">sells</a> a FITS accessory kit for $50 that’s available when building and pricing the vehicle, which includes a rear cupholder, cable organizer, bag hooks, trashcan, and dividers. The lucky ones who <a href=\"https://www.mavericktruckclub.com/forum/threads/rear-cup-holders-on-xlt-and-lariat.485/\">bought the compact truck early</a> (it is now widely sold out) got creative with the slots, designing and 3D-printing their own FITS accessories and putting them up for sale like a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KR2WNQZ2DI\">dog water bowl</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.r3dcustoms.com/product-page/fits-vapers-smokers-cubby\">vape holder</a>.</p><p id=\"yDHjRy\">If you have a 3D printer, some design knowledge, and a 2022 Ford Maverick, then you can check out <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/support/how-tos/owner-resources/vehicle-documents/how-do-i-use-3d-printing-to-customize-my-ford-maverick-pickup/\">Ford’s FITS 3D-printing page</a> for the files. Just make sure you’re not using PLA filament, as I personally found out the hard way and ended up with a warped accessory bin when I left my car out in the sun.</p><p id=\"AKeGoW\">And hey, if it annoys you that Ford doesn’t just include those rear center console cupholders in the Maverick as standard, remember there's still the pull-out armrest cupholders in the XLT and Lariat trims and also the door cubbies. And be thankful that it’s not as bad as Tesla <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-s-rear-seat-cup-holders/\">selling</a> a $150 rear <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Tesla-Motors-Model-S-2nd-row-cupholders.jpg\">cupholder strip</a> for early Model S releases.</p>",
