The OM System OM-1 is a flagship Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera that serves as a successor to previous high-end Olympus models <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21083559/olympus-omd-em1-mark-3-starry-sky-af-mode-mirrorless-micro-four-thirds-camera\">like the O-MD E-M1 Mark III</a>.</p><p id=\"B9qTOY\">The OM-1 name will be a familiar one to Olympus shooters — a <a href=\"https://www.olympus-global.com/technology/museum/camera/products/om/om-1/?page=technology_museum\">35mm SLR camera with the same name</a> launched the OM line in 1972. The new OM System OM-1 still has the Olympus name on the body, though the company <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/om-system-om-1-initial-review\">tells <em>DPreview</em></a> that this is likely to be the last model where that’s the case.</p><aside id=\"9LZvFA\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Olympus E-M1 Mark II review: the camera that warps time\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/30/14119814/olympus-e-m1-mark-ii-camera-review-photography-pro-capture\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"KVQUAb\">The OM-1 has a new 20-megapixel stacked CMOS sensor and an upgraded processor that lets it shoot stills at 50 frames per second with autofocus and auto exposure, or at up to 120 frames a second with focus and exposure set at the first frame — at least when using the electronic shutter with certain Pro-series lenses attached. The OM-1 can also shoot 4K video at 60fps for up to 90 minutes on a battery or two hours with external power. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NwfE0dNoXg-Jk0ANWaJiFhOvFBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23243102/3777724548.jpg\">  </figure><p id=\"XnhaAp\">The body has been redesigned but still looks largely in line with earlier Olympus cameras. Its weather sealing is rated IP53. The viewfinder has been upgraded to a 5.76 million-dot OLED panel, and there’s a 1.62 million-dot 3-inch articulating touchscreen that displays a reworked menu system. </p><p id=\"w7nguL\">At $2,199 for the body alone and $2,799 in a kit with a refreshed 12-40mm f/2.8 lens, the new OM-1 is likely to be a hard sell for photographers who aren’t already invested in Olympus cameras. But it also looks like a big upgrade for those who are — it’s a significant overhaul that brings the Micro Four Thirds line up to date and suggests the new ownership is serious about continuing Olympus’ legacy. It’ll be available early next month.</p>",
