The event page doesn’t say much and Microsoft hasn’t openly discussed the event, but we’ve seen plenty of clues about the kind of hybrid work solutions and security tools Microsoft is working on for businesses where the “office” is more of an idea than a location. That includes <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609090/microsoft-365-free-trials-cloud-pcs-demand-trials\">Windows 365 subscriptions for cloud PCs</a> that you access via a web browser, the rollout of its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538144/microsoft-fluid-components-documents-office-teams-onenote-outlook-whiteboard\">Fluid framework for Microsoft Office apps</a> (now <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22758951/microsoft-loop-fluid-components-office-collaboration-app\">rebranded as Loop</a>), and a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features\">detailed vision of the future of meetings with Microsoft Teams</a>.</p><p id=\"fuo4yG\">Last year CEO Satya Nadella wrote that “Hybrid work represents the biggest shift to how we work in our generation. And it will require a new operating model, spanning people, places, and processes.” Naturally, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hybrid-work-paradox-satya-nadella/?trackingId=qSsWl2a1RnCj0dHpJqE19A%3D%3D\">his LinkedIn post</a> included a screenshot of a metaverse meeting filled with oddly rendered avatars, and Nadella has referenced the term repeatedly since then, so it will be interesting to see how much that does or doesn’t come up in the presentation, or if we see more of Microsoft Mesh.</p><aside id=\"je2wGP\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Microsoft Mesh feels like the virtual future of Microsoft Teams meetings\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features\"},{\"title\":\"Microsoft launches Viva, a bet on the future of remote work\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265954/microsoft-viva-platform-features-remote-work\"},{\"title\":\"Microsoft Loop is a new Office app for the hybrid work era \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22758951/microsoft-loop-fluid-components-office-collaboration-app\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"NXvgfM\"><em>The Verge</em> will be covering Microsoft’s Windows event on April 5th, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p><p id=\"oO0dnR\"></p>",
