Schwartz/Getty Images</figcaption>    </figure>  <p id=\"vt670f\">Spotify reportedly paid Joe Rogan at least $200 million to commit to podcasting on the platform exclusively for three and a half years, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/arts/music/spotify-joe-rogan-misinformation.html\"><em>New York Times</em> report</a>. That number, while astronomical, is double what had previously been reported <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-strikes-exclusive-podcast-deal-with-joe-rogan-11589913814\">in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> as Rogan’s deal price — $100 million — and has continued to be used widely in the media without correction from Spotify’s team.</p><p id=\"uUW1Z6\">This news comes after a volatile month for the audio company and one in which musicians, podcasters, employees, and the medical community scrutinized the company’s work with the controversial podcaster. In January, a group of medical community members penned a letter to the company asking it to remove a Rogan episode they said peddled COVID-19 misinformation. Musician Neil Young read that letter and subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22903354/spotify-joe-rogan-removing-neil-young-music\">pulled his catalog</a> from the platform in response.</p><p id=\"MPgMdx\">“I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines — potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” he wrote. “Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule.” </p><p id=\"CiPnc5\">Since then, inside Spotify, CEO Daniel Ek issued <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22915456/spotify-ceo-joe-rogan-daniel-ek-town-hall-speech-platform-podcast\">multiple statements</a> about his reluctance to moderate Rogan’s show beyond its platform rules, which were <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-30/spotify-platform-rules/\">only made public</a> after Young and others pulled their music. </p><p id=\"S6CXDB\">However, Rogan’s show then became controversial for reasons beyond COVID-19. In a separate viral video, Rogan is documented using the n-word multiple times. After that video surfaced, 70 episodes were mysteriously removed with no reason provided. Rogan later apologized for using the slur and also making a racist joke, but Spotify never commented publicly. In <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/6/22921203/spotify-joe-rogan-episode-removal-internal-memo\">a leaked memo</a>, however, Ek confirmed that the company did talk to Rogan and his team, and Rogan decided to remove the episodes. Ek also said the company would commit $100 million to creators from historically marginalized groups. As <em>Verge</em> contributing editor Casey Newton points <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1494403239621578756\">out on Twitter</a>, that amount seemed to be equal to what Spotify paid Rogan — but now, it looks to be only half as much.</p>",
