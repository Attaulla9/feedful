Usually, the 2020 model of the iPad Air can only be found for $599.99, but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon currently has the 64GB model of this tablet in all colorways for $499.99</a>. While the newer iPad Air comes with Apple’s M1 processor, the A14 Bionic chip in the 2020 model still provides more than enough power for a vast majority of applications. The iPad Air uses a 10.9-inch retina display with a resolution of 2360x1640, but for more details on the specs of the latest version of this tablet, feel free to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22979828/apple-ipad-air-2022-review\">read our review</a> by Dan Seifert.</p><div id=\"EyOY1o\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9546269\"></div></div><p id=\"eMo5eK\">It’s been a while since we showed off <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNintendoSwitch020922/https://www.woot.com/offers/lg-oled-c1-series-65-alexa-built-in-4k-smart-tv\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this deal from Amazon that drops the price of the LG C1 OLED to $1,746.99</a> from its usual price of $2,499.99, but it bears repeating in case you’re in the market. This razor-thin 65-inch OLED panel is popular among<em> The Verge</em> staff, not just for its visual fidelity, but its impressive array of gamer-friendly features. While a 4K resolution is pretty much par for the course among TVs at this point, the C1 has a 120Hz refresh rate, low input lag, and is compatible with G-Sync and FreeSync adaptive sync technology. These features come together for an ultra-smooth visual experience that many TVs struggle to match at this price. Some other nifty features include Dolby Vision, HDR10, and built-in Google and Amazon voice assistants.</p><aside id=\"0jx2XK\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best deals on 4K TVs\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"X2wn9a\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10973167\"></div></div><aside id=\"PcBktI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best deals on 4K TVs\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\"},{\"title\":\"The best gaming TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"xBsTPk\">Currently, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HF6H3X3?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch Series 7 is discounted to $349.99 at Amazon</a> as opposed to its original $399.99 price.
