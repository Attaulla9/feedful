Razer says this is the first time it’s brought its Analog Optical Switches to a keyboard with a 60 percent layout, which means it doesn’t have a function row, numpad, or even arrow keys. The result is a very diminutive accessory, ideal for anyone with limited desk space.</p><p id=\"UEZBjI\">Having analog switches means the keyboard can register a range of inputs beyond its keys being simply pressed or not-pressed. For example, Razer’s software lets you assign two commands to one key (one for a half press, or another for a full press), and you can also change each switch’s actuation point (aka how much you have to push a key before it registers a press). </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lPxucIDOApF6tT3YsRzHcezGRnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23294667/Analog_Switch__Use_for_switch_closeup_only_.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Razer</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Huntsman Mini Analog with has analog optical switches.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"YVSnk9\">Analog control also means you can have individual keys emulate a controller joystick, offering more fine-grained control in racing games, as one example. But this kind of functionality can be a little hit-or-miss in my experience. PC games are generally designed to be controlled with either a gamepad <em>or</em> a keyboard, so combining the two can be messy. Check out my review of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22796553/wooting-two-he-review-analog-mechanical-keyboard-lekker-switches-hall-effect\">Wooting Two HE</a> for an overview of the kinds of problems you can encounter with an analog keyboard.</p><p id=\"KK7Btt\">Other features of the Huntsman Mini Analog include doubleshot PBT keycaps, a detachable USB-C cable, RGB lighting, and a polling rate of 1000Hz. That’s a fairly typical polling rate for a keyboard, but does mean the Huntsman Mini Analog won’t have the kind of responsiveness seen on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677126/razer-huntsman-v2-8000hz-optical-mechanical-switches-clicky-linear-input-lag\">Huntsman V2</a> with its 8000Hz polling rate.</p><p id=\"EBB9gj\">The Huntsman Mini Analog is going on sale this month globally for $149.99 (€159.99).</p>",
