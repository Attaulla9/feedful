Google also previously blocked Russian state media like Russia Today from monetizing their websites and YouTube channels <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/youtube-blocks-rt-other-russian-channels-generating-revenue-2022-02-26/\">using the company’s adtech</a>. Small bans and blocks like this have been accumulating over the past week, and are slowly forming something of a digital iron curtain between Russia and the West. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"u5Tp7J\"><q>“The situation is evolving quickly, and we will continue to share updates when appropriate.”</q></aside></div><p id=\"l8S9fJ\">Regarding this latest news, a Google spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em>: “In light of the extraordinary circumstances, we’re pausing Google ads in Russia. The situation is evolving quickly, and we will continue to share updates when appropriate.”</p><p id=\"n2l9BK\">The move comes after Google itself was criticized by Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor for running ads about the war in Ukraine. As <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-03/card/russia-demands-google-block-false-ads-about-ukraine-war-RxxXhZMePtDOZ9mRu15U\">reported by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Roskomnadzor said ads on Google’s platforms were targeting Russian viewers and “aimed at creating a distorted perception of current events.” Roskomnadzor said the ads spread “false political information” and could incite protest. </p><p id=\"SIljbo\">The communications watchdog has been actively blocking any media that contradicts the official state narrative. It recently blocked access to BBC News websites, for example, after the UK broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22961286/bbc-news-blocked-in-russia-ukraine-invasion-shortwave-radio\">resurrected WWII-era shortwave radio bulletins</a> in order to reach listeners in Russia and Ukraine.</p><p id=\"n5uKGu\"></p>",
