As Russian troops continue to invade Ukraine, YouTube told <em>Reuters</em> it’s “pausing a number of channels’ ability to monetize on YouTube, including several Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions.”</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"pg8Hdl\"><q>RT will be restricted in Ukraine due to “a government request”</q></aside></div><p id=\"ETdIfl\">YouTube spokesperson Farshad Shadloo told <em>Reuters</em> that YouTube will recommend Russian state-run media to users less often. Some of these channels — including RT — will also be restricted in Ukraine due to “a government request,” potentially in response to Ukraine digital minister Mykhailo Fedorov’s <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-russia-google-youtube-apple-and-netflix-facebook-digital-minister-mykhailo-fedorov-big-tech/\">call for YouTube to block Russian propaganda</a> on the platform.

As <em>Politico</em> chief technology correspondent Mark Scott points out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markscott82/status/1497660179311120389\">on Twitter</a>, some state-backed channels still appear to have ads. <em>The Verge</em> asked YouTube for a list of affected channels but didn’t immediately hear back.</p><p id=\"iXSBFP\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22952038/facebook-russian-state-media-blocked-advertising-monetization-ukraine-conflict\">Meta-owned Facebook has already moved to pause ads from state-backed Russian media</a> on its platform, while <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22952128/twitter-pauses-ads-ukraine-russia-conflict\">Twitter suspended all ads in both Ukraine and Russia</a> to help ensure the visibility of public safety information. Russia has since restricted access to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950874/russia-facebook-blocked-roskomnadzor-media-censorship\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22952006/russia-block-twitter-ukraine-invasion-censorship-putin\">Twitter</a>. Although Russia hasn’t blocked YouTube just yet, it <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58737433\">threatened to ban the platform</a> entirely for deleting two RT channels in September.</p>",
