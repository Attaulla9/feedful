Both services acknowledged problems on Tuesday afternoon. However, this time, the culprit doesn’t appear to be any kind of massive <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710963/facebook-dns-bgp-outage-backbone-maintenance\">DNS</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> problem. Sure, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22966533/apple-event-peek-performance-2022-live-blog-updates-news-iphone\">Apple’s event servers</a> are still operational, and we haven’t lost access to security cameras or robot vacuums, but the coincidence is still unusual.</p><p id=\"ToSNYc\"><a href=\"https://discordstatus.com/incidents/cjdx9txnrv03\">According to Discord</a>, after restarting its streaming service to fix one problem, a new issue caused a failure of its API, and as of about 30 minutes ago, they were still investigating. The Spotify Status account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpotifyStatus/status/1501262002236235776\">tweeted</a> at 1:22PM ET that “we’re looking into it” but didn’t offer any other details about what’s going on.</p><p id=\"aqNxe5\">As of 2:39PM ET, Spotify Status <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpotifyStatus/status/1501281462393487360\">tweeted</a> that things are looking much better, and we’ve seen reports indicating that most people are back online. Meanwhile, Discord’s status page notes that “work has begun on restoring service.” So if you’re not reconnected yet, you may be soon.</p><div id=\"JV3fnF\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Something’s not quite right, and we’re looking into it.
