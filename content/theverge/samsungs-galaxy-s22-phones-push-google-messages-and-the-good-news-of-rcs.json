While the Galaxy S21 lineup shipped with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price\">Samsung Messages by default last year in the US</a>, <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/02/14/google-messages-samsung-galaxy-s22-us/\"><em>9to5Google</em> noticed</a> its Galaxy S22 Plus review unit had Google Messages set as the default when set up from scratch, and that’s the case with <em>The Verge’s</em> Galaxy S22 Ultra review unit as well.</p><p id=\"1Cqp6z\">RCS offers many improvements over SMS texting, such as typing indicators, read receipts, and the ability to share higher resolution photos and larger files, but adoption in the US <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google\">has taken years</a>. Google has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271186/google-rcs-t-mobile-encryption-ccmi-universal-profile\">largely led the charge</a> and even rolled out end-to-end encryption to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534173/google-android-summer-features-earthquake-messages-emoji-kitchen-auto-voice-access\">its messaging app in June</a>. But the big carriers have dragged their feet — while they agreed to replace SMS with RCS <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon\">in 2019</a>, we had to wait until 2021 for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup\">T-Mobile</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages\">AT&amp;T</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs\">Verizon</a> to commit to making Google Messages the default messaging app for their Android phones.</p><p id=\"1aAN2v\">Samsung phones make up a significant amount of the Android phones sold in the US, so the switch to Google Messages should be a boon for RCS adoption. Now we just need Apple to get on the RCS train, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877304/google-lockheimer-accuse-apple-imessage-holding-back-rcs-text-sms\">which Google would like, too</a>.</p>",
