But even with the Volvo backing, Polestar is still relatively small compared to the companies that it’s taking shots at in its Super Bowl ad — although presumably it’s hoping that the publicity of the commercial will help change that going forward. </p><p id=\"NxaQal\"><em><strong>Correction</strong></em><em>: The Polestar 2 is a sedan, not an SUV.
