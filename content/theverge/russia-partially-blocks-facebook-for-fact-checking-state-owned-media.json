[to] remove the restrictions imposed by the social network Facebook on Russian media and explain the reason for their introduction,” the Russian regulator said, adding that Meta “ignored” its requests. It’s unclear what Roskomnadzor’s partial restrictions against Facebook mean or if the government is also somehow blocking access to Meta-owned WhatsApp in the country.</p><p id=\"KJEsfI\">In response to Roskomnadzor’s statement, Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, confirmed that the company declined to comply with the government’s requests to “stop fact-checking and labelling of content posted on Facebook by four Russian state-owned media organizations.” </p><p id=\"kqgdLr\">“We refused,” Clegg said in a tweet. “As a result, they have announced they will be restricting the use of our services.”</p><div id=\"AlX0si\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ordinary Russians are using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Meta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Meta</a>'s apps to express themselves and organize for action.
