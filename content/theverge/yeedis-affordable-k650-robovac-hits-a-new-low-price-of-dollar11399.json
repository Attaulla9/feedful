Let’s start with an exceptional value on some robot vacuums. Robovacs get very expensive very quickly, though there are some lower-cost options worth your time. Today, and today only, you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yeedi-XXL-Size-Compatible-Boundary-Self-Charging/dp/B08BJ315DM/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yeedi k650 vacuum for just $113.99 on Amazon’s deal of the day</a> when you click the on-page coupon for an added $20 discount. This sale knocks $66 off the price of this robot vacuum that tackles pet hair and syncs with Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa to slot into your smart home life. It features an extra-large 800-milliliter dustbin, which is helpful because, in the end, you have to empty it yourself.</p><p id=\"5wdSId\">If you prefer the convenience of a self-emptying robot vacuum, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Station-Self-Emptying-Editable-Schedule-Boundary-dp-B092VCXDB1/dp/B092VCXDB1?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yeedi’s Vac Station is also on sale for a very respectable $359.99</a> ($190 off) at Amazon. This one has a mop function and even maps the rooms in your home, though we can’t say what exactly Yeedi is doing with that data. If that is within your comfort zone, the Vac Station is a whole lot of bang for your buck.</p><div id=\"x0cb5K\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10856865\"></div></div><div id=\"h7nhJI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11016307\"></div></div><p id=\"qsRSHh\">The latest version of Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite is discounted at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgz98wAEjdx\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> today, dropping the price down to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$109.99 for the ad-supported model</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$129.99 for ad-free</a>. This $30 off on both models is not the best price to date, but it’s just $5 away from that Black Friday pricing. The new Paperwhite maintains the waterproofing of its predecessor but is now much better for nighttime reading, with a larger 6.8-inch screen and a manually adjustable warm-tone backlight. Also, for everyone’s convenience, the implementation of USB-C charging is a welcome change. </p><p id=\"tvYWY7\">These base Kindle Paperwhite models come with 8GB of storage, which is more than enough for the average reader. If you feel the need for more storage, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Signature Edition features 32GB and also adds an auto-adjusting backlight and wireless charging for $144.99</a> ($45 off). Lastly, one of the greatest values overall can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $119.99</a> ($40 off) and is essentially an ad-free Paperwhite with an included case, two years of accidental damage protection, and one year of Amazon Kids Plus subscription service. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><aside id=\"3EYS2N\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The Verge’s 2022 Valentine’s Day gift guide\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22890136/valentines-day-2022-gift-ideas-couples-boyfriend-girlfriend-partner-friend\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"BxVTq3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10765216\"></div></div><div id=\"gwOrCC\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10765329\"></div></div><div id=\"Aj96bM\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10765369\"></div></div><p id=\"FGyIWi\">While we’re on the topic of Amazon devices, there’s also a slew of deals on Fire HD tablets. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/deal/8fcdf692\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon is currently discounting up to 50 percent off</a> a selection of its line, ranging from 7-inch to 10-inch sizes. This deal includes the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/dp/B07FKR6KXF?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fire 7 for $34.99</a> ($15 off), the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fire HD 8 for $44.99</a> ($45 off), the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Plus-tablet/dp/B0839NDRB2?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fire HD 8 Plus for $54.99</a> ($55 off), the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet/dp/B08BX8CW9V?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HD 10 in 64GB configuration for $149.99</a> ($40 off), and lastly the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Plus-tablet/dp/B08F6FYN6B?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HD 10 Plus for $139.99</a> ($40 off).</p><p id=\"UEMUYA\">That’s a whole lot of savings and a whole lot of inexpensive Amazon tablets! You can pick according to the size that fits your needs most. As for the best value, that nod may go to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Plus-tablet/dp/B0839NDRB2?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fire HD 8 Plus at half-off</a>. The HD 8 Plus is large enough for some comfortable content consumption on Amazon Prime Video and doubles as an Echo smart display when paired with an optional wireless-charging dock. It’s not the fastest device or the highest-quality stream, but for just about 55 bucks right now, it’s a much more enticing value. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21294989/fire-hd-8-plus-review-amazon-prime-android-tablet-fireos-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"jEHT4W\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9736517\"></div></div><p id=\"Rb8o9u\">Smart home devices, e-readers, and tablets are fun and all, but nothing tops games and saving some good money on them. Target has brought back its popular “buy two, get one free” sale, allowing you to mix and match across selected video games, board games, movies, books, and puzzles. Frankly, the best value is using this deal to get some of the latest full-price video games. For example, you can buy <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fdemon-39-s-souls-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-81473774%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals020722\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Demon’s Souls</em> on PS5 for $69.99</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fpokemon-legends-arceus-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-83617997%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals020722\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em> on Switch for $59.99</a>, and get the new <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fs%3FsearchTerm%3Ddying%2Blight%2B2&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals020722\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human</em></a> for free. There are <em>many </em>ways you can swing this deal to get some excellent value, though be aware that there are some caveats. The third free option is going to be your cheapest item of the three. Sadly, this deal does not extend to preorders.</p><div id=\"juq44F\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10860156\"></div></div><h2 id=\"FRSXv2\">Some more deals to mix and match for yourself:</h2><ul><li id=\"mWtXBf\">Target also has a deal on video game gift cards, where you can <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fpl%2F761819538&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals020722\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">buy one and get another one for 15 percent off</a>. If you’re lucky enough to have a Target that stocks Steam gift cards, you can stock up and put them toward a Steam Deck once it’s released.</li><li id=\"GSSNCs\">A <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-HS200P3-Installation-Single-Pole-Assistant/dp/B07HGW8N7R?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three-pack of smart light switches from Kasa is $34.99</a> ($10 off) on Amazon.
