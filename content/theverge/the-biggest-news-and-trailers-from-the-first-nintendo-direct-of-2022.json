And it was a big one: the livestream was 40 minutes long and featured surprises like a portable take on <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, the return of <em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, and a <em>Wii Sports</em> revival. Oh, and <em>Mario Kart 8</em> is about to get a whole lot bigger.</p><p id=\"nDVaAA\">If you weren’t able to catch the whole thing, here are the most important reveals.</p><div id=\"cwfN0c\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLAzzYz92r4?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><h3 id=\"BUcyTL\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/22690146\"><em>Super Mario Strikers</em> is back</a></h3><p id=\"fb7yE8\">Mario’s soccer spinoff is back after a long absence. Nintendo revealed <em>Mario Strikers: Battle League</em>, a sequel to the GameCube original, which looks to include the same wacky gameplay that makes it sort of like <em>Mario Kart</em> but for soccer. It also features support for up to eight players on the same console or via online play. It launches on June 10th.</p><div id=\"si5geQ\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1uZDbDoDAq4?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><h3 id=\"sxKfns\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/22690214\"><em>Mario Kart 8</em> gets a huge wave of new tracks</a></h3><p id=\"2q4yZO\">It’s not <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, but <em>Mario Kart 8</em> Deluxe is getting a massive influx of new content in the form of 48 new tracks, which will be released in waves over the next two years. The paid DLC, which features remastered versions of classic tracks, will essentially double the size of the racer when it’s all out. The first wave launches on March 18th.</p><div id=\"1DEhoj\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TZ16-1YIRAc?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><h3 id=\"fuoIhS\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/22690188\"><em>Wii Sports</em> gets a spiritual successor</a></h3><p id=\"yjn8IB\"><em>Strikers</em> isn’t the only franchise making a comeback.

Now the space exploration game is going portable, thanks to a release on the Nintendo Switch. We don’t know much else about the port, but it’s expected to launch this summer.</p><div id=\"f4Sc1n\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_B-qk4_V2jY?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><h3 id=\"XEvZ3y\">Kirby is a mouthful</h3><p id=\"oJ41e0\">The latest trailer for the post-apocalyptic Kirby spinoff <em>The Forgotten Land</em> introduces a brand new feature, and, well, it’s a mouthful.

That includes a bundle of both <em>Portal</em> games later this year, <em>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</em> on April 20th, the Ezio trilogy of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games on February 17th, a remake of mech game <em>Front Mission: 1st </em>this summer, and a remaster of cult RPG <em>Chrono Cross</em> and its incredible soundtrack on April 7th.

Later this year, the game will also get a boss rush mode.</p>",
