What? <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774836/elden-ring-fromsoftware-hands-on-preview\"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>? No, I’m talking about <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask. </em>Nintendo has confirmed that the cult classic Zelda game will be added to Nintendo Switch Online’s N64 library next week.</p><p id=\"YlZQ6m\"><em>Majora’s Mask</em> was released in 2000 and is visually similar to its predecessor, the seminal <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. It’s a darker and very different game, however, built around a repeating three-day cycle where Link has to figure out how to save the world from imminent destruction by the moon. A remake for the 3DS, called <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask 3D</em>, was released in 2015.</p><p id=\"NVgvW6\">Nintendo 64 games are available to subscribers of Nintendo Switch Online who pay up for the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers\">$49.99-a-year Expansion Pack</a> tier of the service. The Expansion Pack also includes a selection of Sega Genesis games and extra content for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22926173/mario-kart-8-deluxe-is-48-remastered-courses-over-the-next-two-years-as-paid-dlc\">upcoming DLC for <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a>. <em>Majora’s Mask</em> is the twelfth N64 game to be added to the library; future confirmed titles include <em>Pokémon Snap</em>, <em>Mario Golf</em>, <em>Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards</em>, and <em>F-Zero X</em>.</p>",
