This is not the first time we have seen Walmart come in hot with discounts on a new iPad preorder, but if past occasions are anything to go by, it may not last long. </p><p id=\"eLNtgu\">The scheduled shipping date of the new iPad directly from Apple is March 18th, but these discounted preorders have a slightly longer lead time of March 24th. If you can get by with some patience, you’ll have $40 or more back in your pocket.</p><aside id=\"UwMw37\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How to preorder Apple’s new iPad Air \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22958901/apple-ipad-air-2022-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"IdBrmu\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11089494\"></div></div><div id=\"TfdPg8\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11089499\"></div></div><aside id=\"00Wn0o\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
